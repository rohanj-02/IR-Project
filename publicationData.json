In this study, we aim to draw inferences from the perceptual behavior by collecting eye gaze of examiners while they mark minutiae and perform"

Abrogation of mortalin-p53 interaction has been suggested as a target for cancer therapy. We report here a novel multimodal small molecule, called MortaparibPlus, that causes growth arrest or apoptosis of cancer cells by abrogating"

Based on this idea, we propose two algorithms, MC3-R and MC3-S that make different trade-offs between quality and runtime. We conduct rigorous experiments comparing MC3-R and MC3-S with 12 baseline classifiers"

In recent times, encoder-decoder based architectures have achieved state-of-the-art results for image captioning. Here, we present a heuristic of beam search on top of the encoder-decoder based"

The alternate paths are also required to satisfy the same set of QoS constraints as is the case with the primary path. In the paper, we have proposed that the traffic be re-routed along a subpath that bypasses a segment of the primary path that contains the failed link or node"

Using our stepwise and chemically defined system to derive lateral mesoderm progenitors from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), we found that ascorbate increased the expression of mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) markers, purity of MSCs, the long-term self-renewal and osteochondrogenic capacity of hPSC-MSCs in vitro. Moreover, ascorbate promoted MSC specification in an iron-dependent fashion, but not in a redox-dependent manner. Further"

The misinformation riding upon the infodemic wave poses a major threat to people's health and governance systems. Since social media is the largest source of information, managing the infodemic not only requires mitigating of misinformation but also an early understanding of psychological patterns resulting from it. During the COVID-19 crisis, Twitter alone has seen a sharp 45% increase in the usage of its curated events page, and a 30% increase in its direct messaging"

Latent (factor) vectors define the degree to which a trait is possessed by an item or the affinity of user towards that trait. A dense user matrix is a reasonable assumption as each user will like/dislike a trait to certain extent. However, any item will possess only a few of the attributes and never all. Hence, the item matrix should ideally have a sparse structure rather than a dense one as"

Turbidity assay data show that capsaicin does not promote disassembly of collagen fibrils. However, capsaicin"

However, for the remaining three families"

This compound elicits olfactory-mediated oviposition behavior in adult zebrafish mating pairs, suggesting a potential function as a reproductive pheromone for pHPAA itself or a related substance.

Several molecular anomalies may arise clonally prior to diagnosis and continue to evolve temporally with disease progression. These evolving clones may follow either of the evolutionary patterns viz., stable/stable with loss of clone (s)/linear with a gain of clone (s)/branching with both loss and gain of clone (s). While founder clones may initiate and drive the pathogenesis, the later (sub) clones may"

To this end, we propose using semi-supervised techniques to automate the process of identifying backchannels, thereby easing the annotation process"

Towards this objective, we introduce the task of abstractive summarization of Hindi-English (Hi-En) code"

        "abstract": "Multipath TCP (MPTCP) allows applications to transparently use all available network interfaces by creating a TCP subflow per interface. One critical component of MPTCP is the scheduler that decides which subflow to use for each packet. Existing schedulers typically use estimates of end-to-end path properties, such as delay and bandwidth, for making the scheduling decisions. In this paper, we show that these scheduling decisions can be significantly improved by including readily available local information from the device driver"

A content provider (CP) may charge consumers for its content or may earn via advertising revenue. In such settings, a matter of continuing debate, under the umbrella of net neutrality regulations, is whether an ISP serving a consumer may in addition charge the CPs not directly connected to the ISP for delivering their content to consumers connected to the ISP. We attempt an answer by looking at the problem through the lens of a regulator"

The task is challenging due to disjoint views and illumination variation in different cameras. In this direction, many graph-based methods were proposed using appearance-based features. However, the appearance information fades with high illumination variation in the different camera FOVs. We, in this paper, use spatial and temporal information as the state of the target to learn a policy that predicts the next camera"

For example, high fidelity sensing of light intensity under a canopy of tree may require spatial sampling rate of 10 samples/m2 over a transect exceeding 1000 m2. Clearly, adequate sampling coverage of such a transect requires an impractically large number of sensing nodes. We propose here a multi-scale"

A disadvantage of cloud computing is that it is known to have a high latency because of its large distance (both physical distance as well as number of hops) from the end user device. A key technique of enabling low-latency web services, called edge computing, brings the compute resources"

In this work, we instead argue for online selection to localize such transmitters. Online selection can lead to more accurate localization using limited number of"

Due to the immense popularity, there comes the responsibility of validation of the Java software when the software safety, reliability and quality control is of utmost importance. The detection of bugs in the software during the early stage helps to prevent the unbearable cost of human effort and time to fix them when captured at later stages. Hence many effective tools have"

        "abstract": "Automated testing techniques are often assessed on coverage based metrics. However, despite giving good coverage, the test cases may miss the gap between functional specification and the code implementation. This gap may be subtle in nature, arising due to the absence of logical checks, either in the implementation or in the specification, resulting in inconsistencies in the input definition. The inconsistencies may be prevalent especially for structured inputs, commonly specified using string-based data types. Our study on defects"

Developers routinely need to analyze existing code, find better reuse alternatives, and look to develop high-quality code that meets some desired properties. However, searching for such code variants over the web has several challenges. In this dissertation, we address this problem. This dissertation"
