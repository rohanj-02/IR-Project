Aspects concerning modularity and reusability of ontologies are also of utmost importance. It is hard to know of the terms (classes, properties, and instances)"

A reasoner benchmark aids the reasoner developers to evaluate their system's performance and deal with the limitations. Furthermore, it paves the way for further"
