However, warped filters fail to provide variable bandwidth bandpass responses for a given center frequency using first order allpass transformation. To overcome this drawback, our"

The change in FD results in change in amplitude and length of an impulse response. This in turn changes fc and transition bandwidth (TBW) of an FIR filter. The mathematical relation between cut-off"

This work presents a novel approach in which an actor-critic (AC) reinforcement learning (RL) framework is used to enable traffic based ON/OFF switching of base stations (BSs) in a HetNet leading to a reduction in overall energy consumption. Further, previously estimated traffic statistics is exploited in future scenarios which speeds up the learning process and provide additional improvement in"

However, these algorithms work under the assumption that all the SUs faithfully follow the algorithms which may not always hold due to the decentralized nature of the network.

The receiver extracts appropriate order cumulants from the received signal which are then used as features by support vector machine (SVM) based machine learning classifier. Experimental results"

However, these advantages come at the huge cost of increased area complexity and power consumption.

To perform the above task, we propose a sub-Nyquist sampling and sparse ruler based multi-antenna array receiver architecture. By characterizing and selecting a set of frequency bands via a learning algorithm, the proposed receiver allows sensing of more active transmissions than the"

The proposed scheme consists of low complexity reconfigurable fast filter bank (RFFB) followed by a bank of detectors. The RFFB allows high resolution control over subband bandwidth without hardware re-implementation. The simulation results show that the proposed N-subband RFFB based spectrum sensing scheme offers improved performance in terms of searching"

Such transceivers have the capability to adapt to any desired data rate, bandwidth and center frequency depending on the environmental conditions (for example, wireless channel, distance between transmitter and receiver, multipath fading, jammers etc.). Conventional MWCT employs Velcro approach where multiple communication standards are supported using"
