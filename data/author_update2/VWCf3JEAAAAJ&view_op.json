Experimental results demonstrate better performance of MCwSR method compared to the existing methods with reference to normalized mean"

In many applications, UWB devices may be operating in environments with impulse noise sources or narrow band interferers, called as impulse interferer. Impulse noise of high amplitude and random occurrences can overlap a UWB signal making UWB signal recovery difficult at the receiver end. The conventional UWB receiver is not optimal for impulse noise since they are designed for"

The design is modular owing to lifting framework wherein both predict and update stage polynomials are obtained from the given signal. Successive predict stages are designed using the least squares criterion, while the update stages are designed with total variation minimization on the wavelet approximation coefficients. Different design strategies for compression and denoising are presented. The efficacy of matched-wavelets is illustrated on transform coding"

We use the eigenvectors of the auto-covariance matrix of the 2 nd order fBm process characterizing the original ECG signal to design an M-channel uniformly decimated filterbank.

Furthermore, multiple UWB signal clusters (due to multipath channel), in the proposed receiver design, reduce UWB signal blanking loss as compared with the single cluster (single path channel). The proposed receiver's bit error rate (BER) performance is"

The key idea is to employ sophisticated sparse sensing techniques that are cognizant of stable or slowly time-varying channel components against a transient background. Shallow water acoustic channel is generally challenging to track under moderate to rough sea conditions. This is primarily due to non-stationary highly transient elements within the channel delay spread resulting from rapidly fluctuating multipath arrivals"

Proposed technique estimates required parameters to get desirable results. We demonstrate performance on 9 different videos. Motion magnification performance is equivalent to existing manual methods."

Since, these processes are non-stationary; the auto-covariance matrix is a function of time. It is observed that the eigenvalues of the auto-covariance matrix of a dfBm are dependent on the Hurst exponent characterizing this process. Only one eigenvalue of this auto-covariance matrix depends on time index n and it increases as the time index of the auto-covariance matrix increases. All other eigenvalues are observed to be invariant with"

In UWB communication, estimation of ToA is challenging in the presence of impulsive interference and multipath. Generally in literature, ToA is estimated using threshold crossing techniques. Although threshold based ToA methods are simple, optimal threshold value is hard to determine in practice. In this paper, we propose joint estimation of ToA and data symbols by exploiting the cluster-sparsity of the received UWB signal in the"

An approach is proposed for the decomposition of a given signal, consisting of localized waves, into IWFs that can best capture these small waves. To this end, first, we present a method to design a 2-channel signal-matched wavelet system based on least squares criterion. Next, IWFs are designed using this matched wavelet system. The proposed work differs from empirical mode decomposition (EMD) in one"

Since data capture is expensive and time consuming, it is worthwhile to recover missing values instead of re-collecting the data. In this paper, a novel but simple method, namely, DSNN (Doubly Sparse DCT domain with Nuclear Norm minimization) has been proposed for imputing missing values in microarray data. Methods"

In this paper, we propose a design methodology for signal-matched filterbank (FB) with rational decimation factors that achieves perfect reconstruction with FIR filters. We have applied the proposed design on some real world signals. With the proposed design, we obtain a more"

The MMSE criterion requires statistical characterization of the given image. Because wavelet basis expansion behaves as Karhunen\u2013Lo\u00e8ve type expansion for fractional Brownian processes, we assume that the"

A new method of 3-stage DCT based multirate filterbank is proposed for the decomposition of EEG signals into brain rhythms: delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma rhythms. It is shown that theta, alpha, and gamma rhythms can be modeled as 1st order fractional Gaussian Noise (fGn), while the beta rhythms can be modeled as 2nd order fGn processes. These fGn processes are stationary random processes. Further, it is shown that the delta subband"

Hodgkin-Huxley model suffers with two major drawbacks: 1) it does not take into account the dielectric losses in the cell membrane and 2) it models charge separation across membrane by an ideal capacitor. The proposed model addresses these shortcomings by utilizing"

Hence, many HCWs were stressed and burnout. It is known that stress directly"

In this context, this paper revisits the sampling process and proposes to utilize this discarded signal for energy harvesting, naming the method as eSampling, ie"

This paper extends one such recently used phase synchrony measure in two steps. First, multiple temporal models are built from four-mode tensor that are further clustered to detect dynamic brain network"

It is preferable to first impute missing values via robust computational methods rather than repeating the whole experiment to re-capture gene expression data which is an expensive and time-consuming process. In this study, a novel but easy method of imputing missing values in both microarray and RNA-sequencing data has been proposed."

Specifically, the multi-columned structure of the channel delay spread is exploited to design partially sampled dictionary in a two-dimensional (2-D) frequency representation of the channel. The key contribution of this work is to achieve considerable energy saving in the transmission of complex exponential signals, designed specifically for real-time shallow water channel estimation at the receiver"

Therefore, a conventional receiver (correlator or matched filter) designed for additive Gaussian noise system is not optimum for an impulse noise affected communication channel. In this paper, we propose a new robust receiver design that utilizes the received UWB signal cluster sparsity to mitigate impulse noise. Further, multipath channel diversity enhances the signal-to-noise ratio, as compared to the"

PWI requires a long data acquisition time to form a time series of volumes. Hence, motion occurs due to patient's unavoidable movements during a scan, which in turn results into motion corrupted data. There is a necessity of detection of"

Based on this approach, new methods are presented that estimate bi-orthogonal,  compactly supported as well as semi-orthogonal, compactly/infinitely supported signal-matched  wavelets from the given signal.

The key idea is to employ sophisticated sparse sensing techniques that are cognizant of stable or slowly time-varying channel components against a transient background. Shallow water acoustic channel is generally challenging to track under moderate to rough sea conditions. This is primarily due to non-stationary highly transient elements within the channel delay spread resulting from rapidly fluctuating multipath arrivals"
