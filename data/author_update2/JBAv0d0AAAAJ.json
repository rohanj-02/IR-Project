However, the effect of change in body fat has not been studied with respect to face recognition. In this paper, we incorporate weight information to improve the performance of face recognition with age variations. The proposed algorithm utilizes neural network and random decision forest to encode age variations across different"

In order to address the above issue, this research proposes a novel Filter-Drop algorithm for learning unbiased representations. The proposed technique focuses on learning the features useful for predicting the biasing attribute (or the sensitive attribute), followed by their elimination while"

In literature, autoencoders have shown to perform well on a variety of tasks spread across multiple domains, thereby establishing widespread applicability. Typically, an autoencoder is trained to generate a model that minimizes the reconstruction error between the input and the reconstructed output, computed in terms of the Euclidean distance. While this can be useful for applications related to unsupervised reconstruction, it may not be optimal for"

Jain et al.[1] lists seven factors that are essential for any trait (formally termed modality) to be used for biometric authentication. These factors are: universality, uniqueness, permanence, measurability, performance, acceptability, and circumvention. An"
