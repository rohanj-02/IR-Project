However, the randomization of some inputs can lead to an unexpected output, thereby causing failures.

Simulation-based debugging provides accurate and reliable results but incurs a huge computation overhead. In this work, we propose a low overhead machine learning (ML) based solution for debugging failures"

Such applications require a huge amount of information per task, and thereby need frequent main memory accesses to perform the entire computation. In such a scenario, a bigger size last level cache (LLC) would improve the performance and throughput of the system by reducing the global miss rate and miss penalty to a large extent. But this would lead to increased power consumption due to the extended cache memory"
