It is shown that the minimum number of faulty nodes required to destroy all subtrees of height h in a full binary tree of height n is given as f bt (n, h)=\u230a(2 n\u2212 1)(2 h\u2212 1)\u230b.

To evaluate the protocol, we focus on correlation among multiple node-disjoint paths and overheads incurred in routing. We propose schemes to mitigate path correlation and routing"

Given that available energy in sensors is at a premium, it must be conserved by selecting fewer number of sensors to measure distance and communicate to a central tracker. While elsewhere we have presented various heuristics which together can form the basis for selection of a minimum of three sensors, in this paper we provide a theoretical basis for the heuristic that suggests that the three sensors"

Bandwidth is requested in aggregate, resulting in control traffic savings. A unique idea of over-protecting channels on the links for future work savings has been proposed in this paper. Our scheme assumes the knowledge of global topology (but not capacity) information at each node. Using simulation results we"

These schedules, however, may not necessarily be suitable for on-line scheduling. A suitable on-line schedule is one which can accommodate any future task set when it arrives. The traditional approach to solve the on-line scheduling problem is to propose a heuristic, and then to prove its effectiveness by comparing it with existing heuristics using simulation"

The short and regular redundant links improve several properties of the full/binary tree, such as increased tolerance, reduced traffic congestion and efficient routing of messages. It is shown that there exist at least two node-disjoint paths between every pair of nodes in the LAB-tree. In fact, all nonfaulty nodes remain connected in the presence of one faulty node at each"

With suitable constraints involving (i) the window sizes used at both the frame and packet levels to flow control, and (ii) the numbering scheme used to number User Data packets, it is possible to detect and discard all duplicate copies thereof. Further, it is argued that duplication of'messages' by a particular layer be detected at the level where these"

The key insight is that a negative result in the first stage implies negative infection for all individuals. Thus, a single test could rule out infection in multiple individuals.

We propose heuristics on the basis of which a handful of sensors may be selected. In this paper, we present one of the heuristic. The particular heuristic discussed at length is based on colinearity of sensors. In"

In this paper, we consider the problem of tracking a mobile target by appropriately selecting two sensors at a given time. The ambiguity in the target position using only two measurements is resolved by a judicious use of the apriori"

The necessary condition for a TEA CO2 laser to operate simultaneously on  several transitions (with a nearly uniform distribution of intensity) is that the small signal  round trip cavity gain for these be made nearly equal [2].

When an unaugmented full binary tree is faulty, then the computation can be carried out on the largest available non-faulty (full) binary subtree. It is shown that the minimum number of faulty nodes required to destroy all subtrees of height h in a full binary tree of height n is given as f bt (n, h)=\u230e(2 n\u2212 1)/(2 h\u2212 1)\u230f. It follows that the availability of a non-faulty subtree of height h= n\u2212 w, in an n level full binary tree containing u faulty nodes"

In this paper, we present a brief review of protocols reported in the literature and propose a protocol for topology control in mobile ad hoc networks. Our protocol relys on leader election and density based clustering. A problem that may occur in cluster based topology control is usually known as alien-soldier-node problem. We discuss a framework for avoiding aleinsoldier-node problem."

To enable such networks to be readily deployable, auto-configuration is a desirable property. The essential aspect of auto-configuration involves IP address assignment without the need of manual intervention. Most existing schemes involve changes to the software stack of the mobile nodes, thus rendering them hard to implement in a dynamic fashion for every client wanting"
