Deterministically  replaying a shared-memory monolithic OS kernel (like Linux) presents a significant  performance challenge and we demonstrate the use of dynamic binary translation to  achieve this objective.  We present a kernel-level binary translation mechanism which  exhibits near-native performance even on applications with large kernel activity. Our translator"
