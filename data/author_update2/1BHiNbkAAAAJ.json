This solvatochromic reversal is attributed to a change in the solute \u03c0-electron distribution from zwitterionic to neutral following the change in solvents from polar to non polar. Based on our calculations, we suggest that a polar solvent, like water, with larger relative permittivity is influential enough to bring the change in molecular"

In this work, we approach this problem by modeling encapsulation induced changes of the magnetic properties of spin labels for a"

Because the internal motions of lysozyme are related to its function, the changes in these internal motions have been quantified using principal component"

An imaging probe that quantifies fibrillar \u03b1-syn can enhance the clinical diagnosis of PD and can also be used to evaluate the efficacy of therapeutics aimed at reducing the abnormal aggregation of the \u03b1-syn fibril in the brain. In this paper, we study the binding profile of fibrillar \u03b1-syn with a fluorescent probe 4"

We explore the binding modes and structural properties of fibrils at the interface of molybdenum disulphide nanotubes and the nanosurface using classical"

Knowledge of basic molecular and electronic structures of bitumen, one out of the two main components of asphalt, poses a major step towards achieving such a goal. In the present work we employ atomistic simulation techniques to study the interaction of asphaltenes, a major constituent of bitumen, with quartz surfaces.

Along with an increasing number of elderly worldwide, it poses a great challenge for the society and health care. Although sporadic AD is the common form of AD, 2\u20133% of the AD cases are expected to be due to mutations in the \u03b2 region of the amyloid precursor protein, which is referred to as autosomal dominant AD (ADAD). These mutations may cause changes in the secondary structure of the amyloid \u03b2 fibrils and may alter the fibrillization rate leading to changes in the"

To demystify its origin, we have performed computation at the level of ROMP2 in combination with Car\u2013Parrinello molecular dynamics at 300 K on a series of Sc@ C n. Our inspection reveals that a sharp fall of electron correlation in Sc@ C 50 makes the system so sensitive that, to avoid additional Pauli repulsion, Sc leaves the charge component of the solitary 3d"

To explain the microscopic origin of the differences found in those experiments, a series of molecular dynamics simulations were performed. The analysis of molecular short-range order shows that the number of molecules in the first neighbor shell is 12 for the high-density liquid and 11 for the low-density one. It also shows that the angular"
