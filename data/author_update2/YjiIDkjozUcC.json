Crowdsourcing aims to provide incentives to users to deploy a large number of cheap but potentially noisy sensors. The sensors all send their data to a fusion center, where typically some algorithms are used to remove the noise from the data. Such crowdsourced monitoring of spectrum has been shown to be feasible in practice in multiple studies. One of the key goals of such monitoring is to identify any users that are violating the"

With the proliferation of many-core architectures in the embedded community, there has been a trend towards parallelizing implementations of encoders and decoders.

To mitigate this problem, we present SenseWear, a sensor-sharing platform that extends the functionality of a smartphone to use remote sensors with limited additional developer effort.

However, quality of offloading decisions depend on network conditions and hence many offloading solutions assume that MAC layer retransmissions will tackle transient frame errors. This can lead to suboptimal solutions, as well as, degrade service level guarantee of reducing finish time compared to execution without offloading. In this work, we propose an error-aware solution that uses run-time"
