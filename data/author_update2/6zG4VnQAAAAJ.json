Building operations and energy management professionals have long used this simple 1\u2013100 score to understand how their building compares to its peers. This single number is easy to use but is created by potentially inaccurate multiple linear regression (MLR) models and lacks much further information about why a building achieves that score.

While most of the existing solutions involve manual inspection of building premises, surveys, or in-situ sensor deployment, these techniques are intrusive and/or time-intensive, limiting their applicability at larger, city-level spatial scales. Complementing these solutions, we present a wide-area infrared thermography (IRT) based system for measuring a building's operational"
