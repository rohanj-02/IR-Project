However, the task of pitch extraction for singing voice signal is challenging, especially when the music signals are mixed with multi-pitch speech sound signals. Usually, the background music signal is characterized by rhythmic and repetitive patterns in the music-speech mixture. Hence, in this paper we propose a pitch extraction method for such a music-speech mixture, by exploiting these characteristics. The signal processing techniques"
