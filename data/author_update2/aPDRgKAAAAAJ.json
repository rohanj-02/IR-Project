In our proposed algorithm, the copy-paste forgery detection is based on Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature matching and video compression properties. The"

The compression noise is extracted from spatial domain by using a modified Huber Markov Random Field (HMRF) as a prior for image.

As a result, the detection of median filtering has become of great significance for forensic analysis. To this end, several median filtering detectors have been proposed. In order to counter this, various anti-forensic techniques have also been suggested. In this paper we propose an effective anti-forensic"

We learn the subspace by maximizing the ratio of between class covariance and within class covariance using L1 norm instead of the conventional L2 norm. We theoretically show the iterative approach of computing the subspace. In case of noisy data, our experimental"

Given this observation, spatial and temporal regularization and attention models have been investigated. However, these models do not consider the interaction between different feature channels. As a result, dissimilar weights are assigned to similar feature channels. To"

Our formulation explicitly models the variations in the correlation filters and associated spatial weights in successive frames. By imposing a sparsity penalty on these variations, the formulation ensures that only relevant changes are incorporated during updates. This results in more robust filter coefficients that minimize the tracking drift. The IGSSTRCF also includes an adaptive channel importance estimation"
