The data remanence behaviour of DRAMs have allowed to retrieve memory contents when the power has been switched off by an attack known as cold boot attack. In cold boot attack, memory can be frozen using a refrigerant and then removed from the computer. It is then quickly placed into"

However, current flowing through these connecting wires does not decrease in appropriate proportion with the advancement in technology and as a consequence there is steep rise in the current density"

Therefore, they provide additional information on intrinsic condensed-matter properties, making them attractive for imaging applications in the life sciences [1],[2]. Furthermore, they do not have an ionizing effect and are considered biologically innocuous. The ever-present water in organic matter strongly absorbs terahertz waves, and subtle changes in the water concentration can be indicative of disease [3]"

The proposed design consists of a main line with a T-network and a modified conventional reference line with an L-network. For quick prototyping, the design examples are demonstrated to work for several phase shifts upto 90\u00b0 for a wide bandwidth. To verify the given design procedure, a 90\u00b0 phase shifter, working at 1.8 GHz, is prototyped on Rogers5880 with substrate thickness of 1.575 mm and dielectric constant of 2.2. The prototype is able to provide the 90\u00b0 phase"

It is shown through a careful simulation study that at one hand a good bandwidth compared to the Gysel is obtained for the proposed combined structure, at other hand a higher power handling capability is also achieved while utilizing only one grounded resistor. A design methodology and comparison with state-of-the art are also included."

It derives and illustrates the interesting property of a stub to cancel unequal susceptances, irrespective of the sign, at any two arbitrary frequencies of interest. This increases design flexibility and ease. To validate the presented theory, a prototype operating at 1.0 GHz and 1.8 GHz, has been fabricated on RO5880 (\u03b5 r= 2.2). The measured results are in good agreement with the simulated ones."

Digital LDOs (DLDO) have recently attracted circuit designers for their low voltage operating capability and load current scalability. Existing DLDO techniques suffer from either poor transient performance due to slow digital control loop or poor DC load regulation due to low loop gain. A dual-loop architecture to improve the DC load regulation and transient performance is proposed in this work. The proposed"

Cell stability defined by the Static Noise Margin (SNM) of the SRAM cell primarily governs the performance with respect to yield in SRAMs. Variations in the scaled SRAMs increase the probability of cells becoming weak. To ensure reliability of SRAMs it is important to identify such cells post silicon. In this work, we propose a correlation based test methodology to detect the weak bits in SRAMs with respect to SNM.

Design equations in closed form are obtained by using transmission line concepts and simple network analysis techniques. The proposed design is validated using Agilent ADS. This modification also leads to wider bandwidth as observed by a careful simulation."

The performed analysis of the proposed DGS shape shows that the size of the DGS has a huge impact on the quality factor. The cascades of the defects and incorporation of external capacitors aid in achieving the dual-band BSF. Furthermore, the developed BSF demonstrates the ability of wide-band rejection from 6.45 GHz to 12.75 GHz."

The proposed design matches a real load to a conventional 50n source at three arbitrary frequencies of IGHz, 2.4 GHz and 3.8 GHz. The design uses the concept of matching at a reference frequency that is common to both dual band matching sections. A prototype fabricated on FR4 shows good agreement"

To ensure reliability of SRAMs it is important to identify such cells post fabrication.

The circuit can be used in resistive sensing wherein both large and small changes in resistance can be sensed and measured. The circuit gives voltage output in direct proportion to the fractional resistance change. Any non-idealities can be taken care of within the circuit without using any extra elements. In addition, the gain of the structure can be controlled easily. The circuit is simulated using LTspice and experimentally tested in lab. The results of both conform to"

This necessitates the tuning of parameters using Bayesian optimization and Random search algorithms. The outcome in terms of MSE and MAE demonstrates that the Random search algorithm gives a superior agreement with the measured values for the entire frequency"

This brief presents a new and efficient method to generate true random numbers on field programmable gate array (FPGA) by utilizing the random jitter of free-running oscillators as a source of randomness. The free-running oscillator rings incorporate programmable delay lines (PDLs) to generate large variation of the oscillations and to introduce jitter in the generated ring oscillators clocks. The main advantage of the proposed TRNG utilizing PDLs"

It employs port matching using coupled lines to achieve wider isolation bandwidth, without modifying the isolation network. Due to the presence of parallel coupled lines, the design enjoys complete DC isolation. Analysis leading to closed-form design equations shows freedom in choosing design parameters. Many design case studies are provided to show the capabilities of the proposed design. The designed and fabricated prototype shows"

The proposed design, although based on the prevalent method of replacement of various arms of a single-band BLC with an equivalent T-/Pi-network, simplifies the design approach by only replacing either pair of arms and therefore provides four distinct topologies. Closed-form design equations along with insightful comments are reported for all the four topologies of the BLC. A number of cases are investigated to"

The proposed WPT employs a defected ground structure (DGS) concept, therefore possesses an extremely small size of 18\u00d7 18 mm 2 circuit. At first, the design of a dual-band resonator is realized and then this is utilized to develop the dual-band WPT system. Then the proposed WPT is fabricated on Rogers RO4350B. The obtained measured results of 71% and 81% at the frequencies of 0.433 GHz"

The frequency can be changed by changing the voltage division ratio or the time-constant and amplitude by a combination thereof. As an extension of this concept, in the proposed circuit-II a CCCII is used in place of CCII to get electronic control through a bias current. Again, the frequency of the waveform can be adjusted by the bias current of the CCCII or the voltage division ratio"

The proposed design utilizes interdigital electrodes (IDE) to miniaturize the conventional mushroom EBG cell by increasing the inductance of the unit cell. The technique presented in this paper miniaturizes the EBG cell size by 55% wrt standard cell while demonstrating a band gap from 2.32-2.85 GHz. Furthermore, equivalent lumped model of the proposed EBG cell has been developed"
