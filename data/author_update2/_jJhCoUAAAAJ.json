As the pressure was increased, an increase in the cohesive energy density of CO2 caused the substrate/CO2 and water/CO2 interfacial tensions (\u03b3) to decrease, whereas the water/substrate \u03b3 value increased. \u03b8 for the more hydrophobic substrate was predicted"

In contrast, the loadings were small for infusion with pure toluene or toluene mixed with an antisolvent, methanol.

The compression noise is extracted from spatial domain by using a modified Huber Markov Random Field (HMRF) as a prior for image. The transition probability matrices of the extracted noise are used as features to classify a given video as"

One of the major reasons for the deterioration of interior sound quality is the booming noise. Booming noise is a low frequency (20Hz\u223c 300Hz) structure borne noise which occurs mainly due to the powertrain excitations or road excitations. Several methods have been developed over time to identify and troubleshoot the causes of booming noise [1]. In this paper an attempt has been made to understand the"

However, available literature suggests that use of ECT can be at times life-saving in adolescents, especially those presenting with severe catatonia. We treated a 16-year-old female who presented to us with catatonia with a course of nine ECTs, with which she showed marked improvement. Review of the literature suggests that ECT should be considered as the second line treatment in the management of catatonia in adolescents."

Methods A total of 60 patients were recruited after evaluation for sleep disturbances using the Jenkins Sleep Questionnaire (JSQ) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)"

It is an essential part of information security which secures the secret data from eavesdropper. Steganography hides the existence of secret data in order to secure it. Least Significant Bit Insertion technique is applied to hide the secret information. This method modifies the least significant bit of each pixel of cover image. An interesting feature of randomization is that it provides improved image parameters ie Peak"

Not a great deal of neurophysiological assessment has been performed at early stages in patients with epilepsy involving visual and auditory P300 measures. Aims and Objectives: This study aimed to assess the cognitive status in patients with epilepsy earlier by visual and auditory P300 and to find their correlation with various risk factors. Materials and Methods: P300 was recorded in 60 children with epilepsy"

The pitting corrosion is more on the air side as compared to the wheel side mainly due to the presence of air pockets. The pitted regions are enriched with copper suggesting dealloying effect due to its noble nature. The alloy shows very good oxidation resistance"
