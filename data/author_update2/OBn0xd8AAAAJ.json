In this paper, we trace the development of a runtime reconfigurable hardware from a general purpose processor, by eliminating certain characteristics such as: Register files and Bypass network. We instead allow explicit write backs to the reservation stations as in Transport Triggered Architecture (TTA), but use a dataflow paradigm unlike TTA. The compiler and hardware requirements for such a reconfigurable platform are detailed. The performance comparison of REDEFINE"
