Multibiometric systems utilize the principle of fusion to combine information from multiple sources in order to improve recognition accuracy whilst addressing some of the limitations of single-biometric systems. The past two decades have witnessed the development of a large number of biometric fusion schemes. This paper presents an"

In this paper, we propose a regularizer-based approach to learn weight invariant facial representations using two different deep learning architectures, namely, sparse-stacked denoising autoencoders and deep Boltzmann machines. We incorporate a body-weight aware regularization parameter in the"

This paper is an effort to automate the process of matching skull images to digital face images, thereby establishing an identity of the skeletal remains. In order to achieve this, a novel Shared Transform Model is proposed for learning discriminative representations. The model learns robust features while reducing the intra-class variations between skulls and digital face images. Such a model can assist law"

However, effect of change in body-weight is also an interesting covariate that has not been much explored. This paper presents a novel approach to incorporate the weight variations during feature learning process. In a deep learning architecture, we propose incorporating the body-weight in terms of a regularization function which helps in learning the latent variables representative of different weight categories. The formulation has been"

Owing to the challenging nature of the problem, limited research has been performed to automate the process of primate face recognition. In this research, we propose a novel Triplet Transform Learning (TTL) model for learning discriminative representations of primate faces. The proposed model reduces the"
