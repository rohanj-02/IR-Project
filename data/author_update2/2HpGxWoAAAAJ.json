Furthermore, space-time block coding is used in order to cancel the interference at primary as well as secondary receiver.

The D2D user which harvests the maximum energy and achieves the desired target rate for the cellular communication is selected to serve as a decode-and-forward (DF) relay for the cellular user.

However, the information decoder recovers the complete data by utilizing the sparse behaviour of the real world signal, thus not compromising the system performance, unlike the conventional SWIPT protocols such as time switching and power splitting."
