It is frequently used in on-board space vehicle navigation. However, for highly non-linear applications, due to the degraded performance of the EKF, the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) was proposed to deliver better accuracy. The UKF requires more computational time than the EKF. This dissertation proposes two computationally efficient UKFs called the Single Propagation Unscented Kalman Filter"

The non-linearity of spacecraft dynamics in a highly elliptical orbit is high and if the apogee of the orbit is higher than Medium Earth Orbit, the state vector of the spacecraft motion may be only"

But in cislunar space mission like Chandrayaan-2, GPS cannot be used as a navigational aid. In this mission scenario, deep space radar, INS and celestial navigation system are used to determine the position and velocity of the spacecraft.

Next, a formulation relating miss distance of two objects to their collision probability, adopted from literature, is described. Using the"
