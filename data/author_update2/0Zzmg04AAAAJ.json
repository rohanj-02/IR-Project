The theoretical advantage of analysis dictionary compared to its synthesis counterpart is that the former can learn from fewer training s--this"

In this work we propose to improve the robust dictionary learning approach by imposing low-rank penalty on the learned coefficients. The ensuing formulation is solved using a combination"
