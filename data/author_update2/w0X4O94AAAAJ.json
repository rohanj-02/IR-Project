We extracted 231 NAG\u2010interacting nonredundant protein chains from Protein Data Bank, where no two sequences share more than 40% sequence identity. All prediction models were trained"

Over the past decade, interest in peptides-based therapeutics has thrived a lot because of their higher benefit to risk ratio. However, a complete knowledgebase providing a well-annotated picture of the peptide as a therapeutic molecule to cure brain-related ailments is lacking. We have built up a knowledgebase B3Pdb on blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB)-penetrating peptides in the present study. The B3Pdb holds clinically relevant experimental information on 1225"

In addition, IL-13 inhibits tumor immunosurveillance, leading to carcinogenesis. Since elevated IL-13 serum levels are severe in COVID-19 patients, predicting IL-13 inducing peptides or regions in a protein is vital to designing safe protein therapeutics"
