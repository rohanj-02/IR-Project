We developed a method for predicting blood\u2013brain barrier penetrating peptides to facilitate drug delivery into the brain. These blood\u2013brain barrier penetrating peptides (B3PPs) can act as therapeutics, as well as drug delivery agents. We trained, tested, and evaluated our models on blood\u2013brain barrier peptides obtained from the B3Pdb database. First, we computed a wide range of peptide features"

In addition, IL-13 inhibits tumor immunosurveillance, leading to carcinogenesis. Since elevated IL-13 serum levels are severe in COVID-19 patients, predicting IL-13 inducing peptides or regions in a protein is vital to designing safe protein therapeutics"

Of Note, non-classical HLA plays a crucial immunomodulatory role and regulates various immune responses. Recent studies revealed that non-classical HLA (HLA-E & HLA-G) based immunotherapies have many advantages"
