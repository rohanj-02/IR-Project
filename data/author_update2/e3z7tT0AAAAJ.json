In this paper a design methodology for a scalable hierarchical NoC with on-chip millimeter (mm)-wave wireless links is proposed. The proposed wireless NoC offers significantly higher throughput and lower energy dissipation"

Detailed investigations of Wireless NoC (WNoC) highlight their many benefits. But, idle-state power consumption associated with WI interfaces and routers is significantly high. To reduce the idle-state power consumption, a power gating technique can be incorporated with WNoC architectures. However, power gating can lead to adverse"

A key operation of the POSIX Thread standard (PThread) is barrier synchronization, where multiple threads block on a user-specified point of execution until all of them have reached it. Conventional architectures for broadcast operations limit the achievable performance benefits as synchronization is significantly affected due to critical path communications. This increases the network latency and degrades the performance dramatically. A Wireless"

As the devices are scaled and number of transistors on the chip increases, the power density across the chip increases rapidly with each generation.

We have followed Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) for the modelling of the STBUS VIP. Firstly we have verified the important properties of the STBUS protocol and made the VIP. Then we have shown how to use the VIP in a SoC to verify IPs."

This calls for a dire need to properly monitor power usage and take necessary steps to optimize the usage. To achieve this goal, a proper system needs to be developed that can provide the energy requirements and usage at all levels and build automating systems that reduce the unnecessary usage and losses. Towards this goal, we try to design a architecture which"

Wireless links offer high bandwidth, low latency and low per bit energy consumption, along with broadcast capability. While, they offer several advantages, wireless links are inherently unreliable, unlike wired links. Wireless transmission in on-chip network faces challenges from complex channel characteristics, channel sharing and allocation"

Among the various possible techniques pulse transit time (PTT) based approach for estimation of BP is the most promising one. But change in BP is reflected both in PTT and pre-ejection period (PEP). We propose to measure PTT using multiple PPG and PPG-ECG combination recorded at two different sites along the same artery and argue that this approach will eliminate a number of assumptions like constant"

Thus, ensuring almost constant and low ON-resistance (R ON) over complete input signal range without using wide transistors, charge"

With the advancements of the leading edge technologies towards the deep sub-micron realms, the performance of a multi-million transistor SoC is challenged by the aggravation of process variations. Traditionally, the performance of an integrated circuit (IC) is characterized by the clock frequency at which it operates, and is evaluated considering only worst-case gate delays. This is a pessimistic approach, which highly underestimates the performance of the"

Such applications require a huge amount of information per task, and thereby need frequent main memory accesses to perform the entire computation. In such a scenario, a bigger size last level cache (LLC) would improve the performance and throughput of the system by reducing the global miss rate and miss penalty to a large extent. But this would lead to increased power consumption due to the extended cache memory"

Cache coherency models are broadly based on either snoopy coherence protocol or directory-based coherence protocol. While"

As these SoCs have been used in computer, graphics, and networking hardware systems, the complexity of functionality within them have rapidly increased. At the same time shrinking time to market leaves little room for errors in the design. Hence functional verification has become one of the major tasks in committing chips to fabrication. Just as designs are pushing towards"
