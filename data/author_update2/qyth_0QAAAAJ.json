Hence the study of the Airports Networks, the backbone of air transportation, is becoming increasingly important. In complex systems domain, airport networks are modeled as graphs (networks) comprising of airports (vertices or nodes) that are linked by flight connectivities among the airports. A complex network analysis of such a model offers holistic insight about the performance and risks in such a network. We review the performance and risks of"

Our investigations have revealed 'culinary fingerprints'"

Understanding multisensory perception, therefore, is an important area of brain research as it relates to perception and behavior. In this project, the focus of our study is the interaction between auditory and visual perception. We study this interaction through McGurk effect"

A food item is a complex combination of (flavor) molecules, in different proportions, each having their own distinctive flavors. This thesis takes a small step towards understanding the mystery of flavors by analysing the role of the functional groups present in the flavor molecules of the different ingredients present in food ingredients of different categories. We implemented data mining techniques on data from FlavorDB database to arrive at novel insights on functional groups and flavor"

Traditionally, ventilators have been designed to monotonously deliver equal-sized breaths. While it may seem intuitive that lungs may benefit from unvarying and stable ventilation pressure strategy, recently it has been reported that variable lung ventilation is advantageous. In this study, we analyze the mean tidal volume in response to different 'variable ventilation pressure'strategies. We found that uniformly distributed variability in pressure gives the best"
