Nodes in a DSRC network must support messaging of status updates that are time sensitive. Such nodes would like to achieve a small age of information of status updates. In contrast, nodes in a WiFi network would like to achieve large throughputs. Each network chooses a medium access probability to be used by all its nodes. We investigate Nash and Stackelberg equilibrium strategies."

The former is because, at any location, channels in use by TV networks are not available for use by White-Fi. The latter is because the link quality achievable at a White-Fi receiver is determined by not only its link gain to its transmitter but"
