Therefore, the research community is actively working on developing approaches to detect whether a given text is organic or synthetic. While this is a useful first step, it is important to be able to further fingerprint the author LM to attribute its origin. Prior work on fingerprinting LMs is limited to attributing synthetic text generated by a handful (usually< 10) of pre-trained LMs. However"
