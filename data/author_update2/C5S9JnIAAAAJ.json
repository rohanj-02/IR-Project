Community detection is an ill-defined problem, as the nature of the communities is not known in advance. The problem has turned even more complicated due to the fact that communities emerge in the network in various forms such as disjoint, overlapping, and hierarchical. Various heuristics have been proposed to address these"

Though, there are multimodal fake news detection systems but they tend to solve the problem of fake news by considering an additional sub-task like event discriminator and finding correlations across the modalities. The results of fake news detection are heavily dependent on the subtask and"

However, there has been less study on how vertex ordering influences the results of the community detection algorithms. Here we identify and study the properties of invariant groups of vertices (constant communities)"

NLP and Computer Vision communities often leverage only one prominent modality in isolation to study social media. However, the computational processing of Internet memes needs a hybrid approach. The growing ubiquity of Internet memes on social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twiter further suggests that we can not ignore such multimodal content anymore. To the best of our knowledge, there is not much attention"

Providing users with an interface which enables the filtering of recommendations across multiple facets can increase users'"

In this paper, we propose RAN-Debias, a novel gender debiasing methodology that not only eliminates the bias present in a word vector but also"

An implicit assumption is that all the constituent nodes belong equally to their associated community. However, some nodes are more important in the community than others. To date, efforts have been primarily made to identify communities as a whole, rather than understanding to what extent an individual node belongs to its community. Therefore, most metrics for evaluating communities, for example modularity, are global"

Analysing such communities in large networks has rapidly become one of the major agenda in network science. A major limitation of most of the community finding algorithms is that they are highly dependent on the ordering in which vertices are processed, thus minimum permutation in vertex ordering might result in different"

Network augmentation, on the other hand, leverages this feature representation to obtain a more informative network by adding potentially plausible edges while removing noisy edges. Traditional network embedding methods are often inefficient in capturing-(i) the latent relationship when the network is sparse (the network sparsity problem), and (ii) the local and global neighborhood structure of vertices (structure preserving problem)."

We start with the hypothesis that top-tier conferences are much more stable than other conferences and the inherent dynamics of these groups differs to a very large extent. We identify various features related to the stability of conferences that"

However, real-world system security officers use a mix of instruments such as traditional defenses (eg firewalls, intrusion detection systems), and honeypots form only one portion of the strategy. Moreover, the placement of traditional defenses and"

We conduct rigorous experiments comparing MC3-R and MC3-S with 12 baseline classifiers"

The size of this dataset is an order of magnitude larger as compared to existing datasets for fake news detection. Moreover, we collect our training and testing datasets from different news sources to"

In this paper, we propose two ensemble methods: ENDISCO and MEDOC. ENDISCO performs disjoint community detection. In contrast, MEDOC performs disjoint, overlapping, and fuzzy community detection and represents the first ever ensemble method for fuzzy and overlapping community detection. We run extensive experiments with both algorithms"

Therefore, building upon the aforementioned task and predicting if a tweet will incite hate speech is of critical importance. To stifle the dissemination of online hate speech is the need of the hour. Thus, there have been a handful of models for the detection of hate speech. Classical"

The number of citations received by a journal is a crucial factor in determining the impact factor, which may be misused in multiple ways. Therefore, it is crucial to detect citation anomalies for further identifying manipulation and inflation of impact factor. Citation network models the citation relationship between journals in terms of a directed graph. Detecting anomalies in the citation network is a challenging task which has several"

The current study aims to design and evaluate a system to capture how MH symptoms associated with CVD are expressed differently with the gender on social media. We observe that the reliable detection of MH symptoms expressed by persons with heart disease in user posts is"

This problem is critical because the community structure of a network allows us to explore deep underlying insights into how the function and topology of the network affect each other.

In this paper, we extend the study of gender bias to the recently popularized hyperbolic word embeddings. We propose gyrocosine bias, a novel measure for quantifying gender bias in hyperbolic word representations and observe a significant presence of gender bias. To address this problem, we propose Poincar\\'e Gender Debias (PGD), a novel debiasing procedure for hyperbolic word representations"

To account for these characteristics, we create knowledge sharing communities (KSC) that determine the community detection. KSC is driven by weighing the edge attributes as desired for the application that the communities are used. We provide an interactive algorithm that allows"

Moreover, networks in the real world are everevolving and it is impossible to have complete information about a network at any given time. The aim of this thesis is to study the different techniques for the exploration of the incompletenetwork available. The motive is to explore the incomplete network such that"
