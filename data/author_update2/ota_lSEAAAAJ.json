This function appears as a subroutine for many algorithms for graph problems such as maximum independent set and maximum clique.

We present a general algorithmic solution based on solving the problem variant without the cardinality constraint. We yield constant factor approximations depending on the solvability of this relaxation for a large class of submodular cost functions. We give optimal algorithms for special graph classes. More"

The goal is to pick a smallest cardinality sub-collection \ud835\udcae'of \ud835\udcae such that each point is covered by at least d (x) sets from \ud835\udcae'.

In the geometric setting, this naturally translates into the study of separators in the intersection graphs of geometric objects. Recently a number of new separator theorems have been proven for the case of geometric objects in the plane. In this paper we present a new separator theorem that unifies and generalizes some earlier results."

From known results it follows that for any forest F on 5 vertices the vertex colouring problem is polynomial-time solvable in the class of (K 3, F)-free graphs.

We can show this by simulation. ie, simulate D to behave exactly like M and vice-versa."
