One critical component of MPTCP is the scheduler that decides which subflow to use for each packet. Existing schedulers typically use estimates of end-to-end path properties, such as delay and bandwidth, for making the scheduling decisions. In this paper, we show that these scheduling decisions can be significantly improved by including readily available local information from the device driver"

In addition to addressing the most urgent issues of TCP, QUIC ensures its future extendibility and is destined to drastically change the transport protocol landscape.

Using the MPTCP scheduler as an example, in this paper we demonstrate that exploiting cross-layer information and optimizing scheduling decisions jointly over the multiple flows, can lead to significant performance gains.

Using real-world experiments, we show that commonly used methods of prioritization (DSCP at the IP layer and EDCA at the 802.11 MAC layer) in networks are highly effective in isolating status update flows from the impact of high throughput flows in the absence of WiFi access"
