Consensus methods frequently perform very well when there is a clear consensus, but this is not always the case. In particular, they frequently fail in selecting the best possible model in the hard cases (lacking consensus) or in the easy cases where models are very similar. In"

Newer methods are thus, highly desired for comprehensive analysis of lipid species including identification of structural isomers. Herein, we propose a targeted-MRM method for"

They can serve as substrate/ligand-binding sites, pave path for movement of biomolecules and even mediate structural conformations occurring between domain interfaces during structural transitions. Yet, there is a paucity of computational tools that can accurately and reliably characterize the inner cavities of the proteins, a prerequisite for elucidating their functions.
