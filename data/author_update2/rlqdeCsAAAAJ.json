Here we propose a computational method called Triplex Domain Finder (TDF) to detect triplexes and characterize DNA-binding domains and DNA targets statistically. Case studies showed that"

Cells were harvested at Day 0 (undifferentiated hPSCs) and day 4 (cardiac progenitors) and lysed in TRIzol (ThermoFisher). After RNA extraction, genomic DNA was removed by DNase digestion (ThermoFisher). Digested RNA was purified by ethanol precipitation and quality checked on a Bioanalyzer (Agilent 2100). Subsequently, 1 ig of RNA was depleted of ribosomal RNA (Ribo-Zero) and used for sequencing library prep"
