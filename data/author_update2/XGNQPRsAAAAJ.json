We propose noise injection as a more flexible option than hardware attenuation and consider methods for mapping real world wireless network topologies onto the testbed. Our experimental results show that additive white Gaussian noise effectively reduces the radio range, without the need for hardware attenuation and careful shielding of wireless cards. We"

One critical component of MPTCP is the scheduler that decides which subflow to use for each packet. Existing schedulers typically use estimates of end-to-end path properties, such as delay and bandwidth, for making the scheduling decisions. In this paper, we show that these scheduling decisions can be significantly improved by including readily available local information from the device driver"

In very dense networks, such safety messaging can lead to offered traffic loads that saturate the shared wireless medium. One approach to address this problem is to reduce the frequency of location update messages when the movements of a vehicle can be predicted by nearby vehicles. In this paper, we study how predictable vehicular locations are, given a Global Positioning System trace of a vehicles recent path"

To do so, a client sends out a probe request, in response to which all APs that hear the request send a probe response. Prior works have reported severe degradation in performance of WiFi networks due to excessive AS. In practice, a client triggers AS due to many causes, for example, when the screen of a smartphone turns on, or on the loss of beacons from its AP. This work provides"

MPTCP bases its scheduling decisions on the individual RTT values observed at the subflows, but does not attempt to perform any kind of joint optimization over the subflows. Using the MPTCP scheduler as an example, in this paper we demonstrate that exploiting cross-layer information and optimizing scheduling decisions jointly over the multiple flows, can lead to significant performance gains.

As a result, optimization of citywide White-Fi networks faces the challenges of heterogeneous channel availability and link quality, over location. The former is because, at any location, channels in use by TV networks are not available for use by White-Fi. The latter is because the link quality achievable at a White-Fi receiver is determined by not only its link gain to its transmitter but"

With the provision for artificial creation of coverage zones and interference patterns, we demonstrate how this system will substantially lower the barrier to large-scale mobile systems experimentation."

To model competition, we define a non-cooperative stage game parameterized by the average age of the AON at the beginning of the stage, derive its mixed strategy Nash equilibrium (MSNE)"

However, the appearance information fades with high illumination variation in the different camera FOVs. We, in this paper, use spatial and temporal information as the state of the target to learn a policy that predicts the next camera"

This study presents a discussion to justify why, and how often randomly generated adjacency matrices may not not conform to wireless topologies in the physical world. Specifically, it shows through analysis and random trials that, more than 90% of times, a randomly generated adjacency matrix will not conform to a valid wireless topology, when it has more than 3 nodes. By showing that node triplets in the adjacency"

We present the design and implementation of a mobility emulation system that uses novel software techniques and controlled interference injection to facilitate experiments with a large number of \u201cmobile\u201d IEEE 802.11 radios. With the provision for artificial creation of coverage zones and interference patterns, we demonstrate how this system will substantially lower the barrier to large-scale mobile systems experimentation."
