However, present-day Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems are not able to capture user requirements and present a rigid interface to its users, and thus the IVR systems are commonly considered as frustrating to use. In this paper, we are proposing an architecture to build context-aware IVR"

The generation of high-fidelity data requires the model to have three strengths: capture feature correlations, model long-term dependencies, and scalability in dimensions. This paper analyzes these"
