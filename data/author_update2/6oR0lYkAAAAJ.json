In this conversion, a good amount of signal energy is wasted because signal that is captured within the sampling duration is utilized, while rest of the signal waveform is discarded. In this context, this paper revisits the sampling process and proposes to utilize this discarded signal for energy harvesting, naming the method as eSampling, ie"

However, the nonlinear characteristics and dimming nature of LED limits the performance of the VLC system by degrading the quality of transmitted signal. In this paper, we propose an adaptive-learning-architecture (ALA) based predistortion technique to estimate and compensate for LED nonlinearities as well as increase the spectral efficiency"

Full-duplex (FD) systems have the potential to double the spectral efficiency (SE) of current half-duplex communication systems. The major challenge in FD systems is the suppression of strong self-interference (SI) imposed by the transmit signal on its receiving antennas"

In multi-stage PD, digital predistortion (DPD) is implemented in two or more stages. Using the proposed algorithm each stage of the multi-stage PD can be identified separately by taking into account the contribution of all other stages. The algorithm is iterative and shown to converge after few system-level iterations. Through system level simulation, it has also been demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can be successfully"

In the first part, it is assumed that human blockages are static. The closed-form expression of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver with static human blockages is derived. Further, the"

Specifically, the closed form expression of EVM is derived for dual band carrier aggregated OFDM signals with nonlinear HPA in the presence"

However, the FD transmission mode (TM) may not consistently outperform the half-duplex (HD) TM due to the residual SI. In contrast, an adaptive FD/HD transmission scheme utilizes the advantages of both FD and HD TM. This paper proposes an adaptive FD/HD transmission scheme for a cooperative device-to-device (C-D2D) communications system wherein cellular uplink data"

The motivation behind the work lies in the outrageous expansion of already existing night lights which primarily use light-emitting diodes (LEDs) for illumination. Most of them are not in use simultaneously. We present a futuristic approach in automating these redundant lights. To automate the redundant LEDs, we propose using a wireless feedback mechanism for the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) from the user to the LEDs"
