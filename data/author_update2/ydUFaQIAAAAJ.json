The main objective is to ensure fair service to the users by maximizing the rate of the worst-off user. To this end, we jointly optimize the three-dimensional (3-D) placements of the UAV-BSs, the multiple subchannel assignment to each user, and the transmit power of each subchannel. The presented problem is non-convex in nature. In order to solve this problem, we propose to divide it into three tractable"
