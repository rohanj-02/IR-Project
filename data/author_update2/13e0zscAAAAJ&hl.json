However, a single-level decomposition may not be suitable for the speech signal, as it contains complex hierarchical information about various hidden attributes. In this paper, we propose to use a multilevel decomposition (having multiple"

In order to effectively capture the variations in a speech unit, the proposed method employs multiple class specific dictionaries. Here, the training data belonging to each class is clustered into multiple clusters, and a principal component analysis (PCA) based dictionary is learnt for each cluster. It has been observed that coefficients corresponding to middle principal components can effectively discriminate among different speech units"

The proposed approach sparsifies the data using voxels with high BOLD values (signal intensity) and nullifies the ones accounting for pseudo activations. In other words, the spatial complexity of rs-fMRI data is efficiently reduced by projecting data such that it has highest covariance and variance. This operation is followed by low-rank projection of sparsified data"

Initialization on the network mean field (MF) edge of chaos (EOC) results in maximal information propagation through layers of even DNNs; consequently their IB plots are effectively single"

Since, extremal points have the sparsest convex representation, archetypes are identified by projecting the data in a linearly transformed/coefficient space involving sparse matrices.

In this paper we study how to avoid two problems at initialisation identified in prior works: rapid convergence of pairwise input correlations, and vanishing and exploding gradients. We prove that both these problems can be avoided by choosing an activation function possessing a sufficiently large linear region around the origin, relative to the bias variance \u03c3"

SCT is a cluster head rotation based protocol used for cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks. A modified transmission and reception radio model based on SCT is proposed for cognitive radio networks. Further the paper evaluates the effect of number of users, sectors and hierarchy levels on energy efficiency in SCT protocol. The frame structure for sending secondary users spectrum"
