In order to boost social presence, OSN users need to increase the visibility and reach of their online profile, like-Facebook likes, Twitter followers, Instagram comments and Yelp reviews. For example, an increase in Twitter followers not only improves the audience reach of the user but also boosts the perceived social reputation and popularity. This has led to a scope for an underground market that"

The task is made difficult due to non-fixed grammar, vocabulary, semantics and spellings of Hinglish language. We apply transfer learning and make a LSTM based model for hate speech classification.

Thus it becomes imperative for video recommendation engines to look for novel and innovative ways to recommend the newly added videos to their users. However, the problem with new videos is that they lack any sort of metadata and user interaction so as to be able to rate the videos for the consumers. To this effect, this paper introduces the several"

In this study, we address this gap for a targeted user group, ie clinicians, researchers, and policymakers by applying natural language processing to develop a CovidNLP dashboard in order to speed up"

We also discuss the adverse effects of such unpredictability on passengers waiting for the cabs, leading to a whopping 28.4% of the requested trips being"

Several studies have focused on mining evidence from text using natural language processing, and have focused on a handful of diseases. Here we show that new knowledge can be captured, tracked and predicted using the evolution of unsupervised"

User behaviors in different social networks drive the construction of these datasets, and as a consequence, behavioral biases get manifested in them. Our work performs a detailed"

Sharing information was also based on the logic of superimposing information with an epistemic ascription to the networks from where they received it.

This problem is critical because the community structure of a network allows us to explore deep underlying insights into how the function and topology of the network affect each other.

In this study, we introduce a geometric method to estimate the polysemy of words using the discrete Ollivier-Ricci curvature of a graph of synonyms in Hindi. We show that this approach can effectively measure the polysemy of words and is strongly correlated with theoretical interpretations of polysemy."

The lack of content moderation on this network leaves it as vulnerable to polarizing content like Facebook, Twitter, and Whatsapp. In this research, we collected data for two social media platforms: Namo App and Tweets shared through the NaMo app. We have obtained"

A possible solution to this problem is to use machine learning to automatically evaluate the credibility of a tweet, ie whether a person would deem the tweet believable or trustworthy. This has been often framed and studied as a supervised classification problem in an off-line (post-hoc) setting. In this paper, we present a semi-supervised ranking model for scoring tweets according to their"
