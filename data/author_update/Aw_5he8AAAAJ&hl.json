While the aliphatic, aromatic, alicyclic, and heterocyclic analogues of differently substituted ureas are well established, the N21, N22-carbamide-porphyrinoid derivatives have been reported rarely.

As expected, we have not observed the formation of any unusual \u03c3\u2010methyl/phenyl derivatives."
