It also acts on bacterial spores which eliminates the chances of resurfacing of the infection. However, in recent years there has been a major increase in the occurrence of drug resistant bacterial strains. Resistance against PZA is caused by mutations in pyrazinamidase (PncA) protein which is the activator of the prodrug PZA. In the present study, we have tried to gain insights into the"

Activation of NF-\u03baB is strictly controlled by I\u03baB kinase, and therefore I\u03baB kinase inhibition forms the basis for anticancer drug research. We present here a novel fragment-based QSAR model using 4-arylidene curcumin analogues having I\u03baB kinase inhibitory properties. The insights into the contribution of each chemical fragment of the analogues in I\u03baB kinase inhibitory activity were"
