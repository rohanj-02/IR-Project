For gender it is a two class problem; for age, several age brackets are created to form classes. In this work we formulate it as a regression problem. This is a natural way to handle both gender and age. Gender can be represented as a single variable possible of taking binary values (male or female) whereas age can be"

Compressed sensing (CS) based techniques have been used rampantly for the said problem. Later studies, instead of employing a fixed basis (like DCT, wavelet etc. as used in CS), learnt the basis adaptively from the image itself. Such studies, loosely dubbed as dictionary learning (DL) showed marked improvement over CS. This work proposes deep dictionary learning based inversion. Instead of learning a single"
