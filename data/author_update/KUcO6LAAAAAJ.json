Moreover, while previous work has focused on specific aspects of memes such as hate speech and propaganda, there has been little work on harm in general. Here, we aim to bridge this gap.

The hate mongers misuse the freedom of speech in social media platforms to flood with their venomous comments in many forms. Identifying different traits of online offense is thus inevitable and the need of the hour. Existing studies usually handle one or two offense traits at a time, mainly due to the lack of a combined annotated dataset and a scientific study that provides insights into the relationship among the traits. In this paper, we study the"
