Several algorithms were proposed to find high-utility itemsets from transaction databases and use a data structure called UP-tree for their working. However, algorithms based on UP-tree generate a lot of candidates due to limited information availability in UP-tree for computing utility value estimates of itemsets. In this paper, we present a data structure named UP-Hist tree which maintains a histogram of item quantities with each node of the tree. The"

There is always a trade-off between cost of final matching and cost of candidate pair generation.

The utility framework introduced in episode mining provides more informative and usable knowledge as compared to frequent episode mining. However, it is difficult for the user to set an appropriate minimum utility thresh-old. As the user cannot predict the count of mined episodes by the utility threshold, the number of"

Several algorithms were proposed to find high-utility itemsets from transaction databases and use a data structure called UP-tree for their working. However, algorithms based on UP-tree generate a lot of candidates due to limited information availability in UP-tree for computing utility value estimates of itemsets. In this pa-per, we present a data structure named UP-Hist tree which maintains a histogram of item quantities with each node of the tree. The"

Previous work has shown that it is important to replicate the data-view captured by the black-box deep learning model to create effective interpretable shadow"

Existing solutions either use crowd-sourced data or sophisticated technologies to perform the task, and hence are costly and unreliable. In this thesis, we propose a machine learning technique that uses the public transport movement data to predict the speed/congestion on a given road segment. Specifically, we use DIMTS buses movement data that comes in the form of GPS trajectories. The technique, we call as STH-Model (Spatio-Temporal-Historical"

In this dissertation, a framework has been proposed for RkNN query over directed graphs"
