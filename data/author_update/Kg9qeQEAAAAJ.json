We compare the capacities between networks operating on fixed and  flexible spectrum regimes, and further explore the benefit of the optimized WSS passbands  in these scenarios. Simulations are carried out over both BT-UK and PAN-Europe networks  in order to investigate the impact from different network characteristics."

The signal quality degradation due to the dispersion effect in longer lightpaths is higher than that of shorter lightpaths in a dispersion uncompensated network. DRWA assigns the longer distance lightpath requests to the wavelengths having a lower dispersion effect, and the wavelengths having a higher dispersion effect are allocated to the shorter distance lightpath requests. Thus, the signal"
