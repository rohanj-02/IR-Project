It provides low-resource hardware implementation, which is proper to ubiquitous computing device such as a sensor in USN or a RFID tag. HIGHT does not only consist of simple operations to be ultra-light but also has enough security as a good encryption algorithm. Our hardware implementation of HIGHT requires 3048 gates on 0.25 \u03bcm technology."

It is designed not only to have higher security but also to be faster than SHA-256. The performance of the new hash function is at least 30% better than that of SHA-256 in software. And it is secure against any known cryptographic attacks on hash functions."

Recently, in Crypto 2017, Gaborit et al. proposed a first identity-based encryption scheme from codes with rank metric, called RankIBE. To extract the decryption key from any public identity, they constructed a trapdoor function which relies on RankSign, a signature scheme proposed by Gaborit et al. in PQCrypto 2014. We adopt the same trapdoor function to add efficient key revocation functionality in the RankIBE scheme. Our revocable IBE"

For these compression function modes, block ciphers are used with a key that is known to the attacker.

There is an existing body of third-party analysis on the earlier versions of the Grain family that provide insights on the security of Grain-128AEAD. Different from the earlier versions, Grain-128AEAD reintroduces the key into the internal state during the initialization. The designers claim that internal state recovery no longer results in key recovery, due to this change. In this paper, we analyze this claim under different scenarios."

Each DBL hash function uses a constant which has a role to make the DBL hash function collision-resistant in the ideal cipher model. However, we have to instantiate a block cipher. In this paper, we show that the constant may be used as a trapdoor to help a attacker to find a collision easily. In case of 256-bit output size, we can find a collision with the complexity $2^{64} $. This is a gap between the security of the DBL hash function in the"

We first construct a 8-round distinguisher on 4-branch, Type-2 GFN and then use this distinguisher to launch 8-round collision attack"

A major hurdle in carrying out biclique cryptanalysis is that it has a very high query complexity (of the order of 288 for AES-128, 280 for AES-192 and 240 for AES-256). This naturally puts a big question mark over the practical feasibility of implementing biclique attack in real world. In this work, we re-evaluate the security of full round AES against biclique cryptanalysis. We describe an alternate biclique construction"

A cellular automata is a finite state machine and has the property of generating pseudorandom numbers efficiently by combinational logics of neighbour cells. In [1] and [7], hash functions based on cellular automata which can be implemented efficiently in hardware were proposed. In this paper, we show that we can find collisions of these hash functions with probability 0.46875 and 0.5 respectively."
