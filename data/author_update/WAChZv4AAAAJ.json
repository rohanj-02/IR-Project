With the rise of candidates taking these assessments and the shortage of qualified experts rating these assessments, there is a need to automate this time consuming process. We propose a novel deep learning technique for non native automated speech scoring called Recursive Modeling wherein we feed our text based models with additional speaker specific context. We compare our technique with strong baselines and find that such modeling significantly"

However, many outdoor user-generated videos (UGVs) lack a certain appeal because their soundtracks consist mostly of ambient background noise. Aimed at making UGVs more attractive, we introduce ADVISOR, a personalized video soundtrack recommendation system.

Most existing work has focused on estimating the likelihood of a candidate path based on the GPS observations, while neglecting to model the probability of a route choice from the perspective of drivers. Here we propose a novel feature-based map matching algorithm that estimates the cost of a"

Among one of the initial steps of positioning data management, map matching aims to reduce the uncertainty in a trajectory by matching the GPS points to the road network on a digital map. Most existing work has focused on estimating the likelihood of a candidate route based on the GPS observations, while neglecting to model the probability of a route choice from the perspective of drivers.

To this end, we present a simple and robust architecture using foreground extraction and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

In a novel step to solve this problem, we present an annotated Emergency Blood Donation Request (EBDR) dataset to classify tweets referring to the"

Attention fusion is performed on these learned predictive features to learn complex interactions between different modalities before"

The rise in fashion industry and its effect on social influencing have made outfit compatibility a need. Thus, it necessitates an outfit compatibility model to aid people in clothing recommendation. However, due to the highly subjective nature of compatibility, it is necessary to account for personalization. Our paper devises an attribute-wise interpretable compatibility scheme with personal preference"

Predicting listener backchannels is one such actively-researched task. While many studies have used different approaches for backchannel prediction, they all have depended on manual annotations for a large dataset. This is a bottleneck impacting the scalability of development. To this end, we propose using semi-supervised techniques to automate the process of identifying backchannels, thereby easing the annotation process"

To this end, we reformulate suicide risk assessment as an Ordinal Regression problem, over the Columbia-Suicide Severity Scale. We propose SISMO, a hierarchical attention model"

Our strategy is to create virtual training samples by interpolating speech samples in hidden space. SpeechMix has the potential to generate an infinite number of new augmented speech samples since the combination of speech samples is continuous. Thus, it allows downstream models to avoid overfitting drastically. Unlike other mixing strategies that only work on the input space, we apply our method on the intermediate layers"

Compared to visual inputs, acoustic cues tend to be less descriptive and less consistent in time domain. The duration of a sound event can be quite short, which creates great difficulties for, especially weakly labeled, audio tagging. To solve these challenges, we present a novel end-to-end multi-level attention model that first makes segment-level predictions with temporal modeling, followed by advanced aggregations"

However, most of them have consistently focused on classification mature stage cell images into binary categories of ALL or normal cells. The real impetus of biomedical imaging lies in detecting early-stage cases since early-stage ALL cells have unintuitive global contextual and local spatial features, making their detection non-trivial. To this effect, we propose a novel"

Aim of proposed model is to decide which text is more coherent among given text. This problem has been addressed from many different perspectives.

As human attention span shrinks, it is imperative to shorten videos while maintaining most of its information. The premier challenge is that summaries more intuitive to a human are difficult for machines to generalize. We present a simple approach to video summarization using Kernel Temporal Segmentation (KTS) for shot segmentation and a global attention based"

With the widespread adoption of conversational agents and chat platforms, code-switching has become an integral part of written conversations in many multi-lingual communities worldwide. Therefore, it is essential to develop techniques for understanding and summarizing these conversations. Towards this objective, we introduce the task of abstractive summarization of Hindi-English (Hi-En) code"

Since such research problems and topics help researchers to be updated with new topics in research, it is essential to know trends in research based on topic significance over time.

However, existing methods to craft universal triggers are data intensive. They require large amounts of data samples to generate adversarial triggers, which are typically inaccessible by attackers. For instance, previous works take 3000 data samples per class for the SNLI dataset to generate"

We apply various pre-processing techniques before training the language and the classification model. We further provide analysis of the model.

During perceptual attunement, a critical and sensitive developmental trajectory has been examined in bilingual and monolingual infants where they can best discriminate common phonemes. In this paper, we compare and identify these cognitive aspects on deep neural-based visual lip-reading models. We conduct experiments on the two most extensive public visual speech recognition datasets for"
