The traditional wavelet system is implemented using integer decimation factors, although frequency tiling offered by rational decimation may better adapt to signal characteristics. In this paper, we propose a design methodology for signal-matched filterbank (FB) with rational decimation factors that achieves perfect reconstruction with FIR filters. We have applied the proposed design on some real world signals. With the proposed design, we obtain a more"

The task is to estimate a dense disparity map given two stereo images. Instead of computing the full disparity map, we only compute the disparity values for randomly selected epipolar lines. The output of this exercise is a sampled disparity map; from the sampled disparity map, the full map is reconstructed by exploiting the sparsity of the map in Fourier domain using"

Hand crafting a NoC that meets PPA requirements within Time-to-Market (TTM) constraints is difficult if not intractable for real world systems.
