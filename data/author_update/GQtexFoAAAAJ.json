Our results show that equity shares are welfare improving under certain conditions, but can lead to a socially insuffi cient exploitation of the CPR if shares are large enough; as in a merger where firms equally share"

When consumers face two-part tariffs from the ISP, the equilibrium is sensitive to usage price level but is invariant to its structure on two sides.

We identify equilibrium appropriation in this setting, and compare it against the social optimum. Our results show that equity shares can be welfare improving only under certain conditions, but lead to a socially insuffi cient exploitation of the CPR if shares are large enough. As a result, we demonstrate that emission fees are decreasing in"

Hardin (1968) proposed that since they are free to consume and limited in quantity, CPRs are consumed inefficiently. However, experiments and research has shown that behavioral factors and uncertainty can reduce over-consumption. In this paper, we develop a model to explain CPR consumption by combining some of these ideas into one model."
