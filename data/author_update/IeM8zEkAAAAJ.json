Several algorithms were proposed to find high-utility itemsets from transaction databases and use a data structure called UP-tree for their working. However, algorithms based on UP-tree generate a lot of candidates due to limited information availability in UP-tree for computing utility value estimates of itemsets. In this paper, we present a data structure named UP-Hist tree which maintains a histogram of item quantities with each node of the tree. The"

In this pa-per, we present a data structure named UP-Hist tree which maintains a histogram of item quantities with each node of the tree. The"

Such data, commonly known as {\\it activity-trajectory data}, can be analysed to find common user movements and preferred activities, which will have tremendous business value. However, various countries have now introduced data privacy regulations that make it mandatory to anonymize any data before releasing it. This makes it"

The SKYMINE algorithm requires, however, the amounts of computation to mine the SFUPs based on the utility-pattern (UP)-tree structure performing in a level-wise manner. In this paper, we propose more effective algorithms to mine the SFUPs based on the utility-list structure. Substantial experiments are carried to show that the proposed algorithms"
