The first layer is learnt from the smart-meter data; subsequent layers are learnt from features obtained from the previous layer. For disaggregation, instead of using a single level of dictionary as the basis for each device, we use the multiple level dictionaries. Experimental results show that by"

The proposed approach works as a fully automatic recognition scheme as well as a semi-automatic human-interactive recognition system."

Experiments have been carried out on denoising, super-resolution, and reconstruction. For each problem, our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art."

They used off-the-shelf algorithms for classifying static signals on NILM problems. This is the first work that shows how to account for the temporal variability of input signals in a multi-label classification framework. Results on benchmark datasets like REDD"

Impulse noise is sparse; removing impulse noise requires minimizing an l 1-norm data fidelity term. Prior studies have exploited the intra-band spatial correlation (leading to sparsity in transform domain) and inter-band spectral-correlation (joint-sparsity) of hyper-spectral images for Gaussian denoising. In this work, we propose to learn the joint-sparsity promoting dictionary adaptively from the data for impulse denoising problems. Unlike"

The task is to estimate a dense disparity map given two stereo images. Instead of computing the full disparity map, we only compute the disparity values for randomly selected epipolar lines. The output of this exercise is a sampled disparity map; from the sampled disparity map, the full map is reconstructed by exploiting the sparsity of the map in Fourier domain using"

Signal processing research aims at reducing the scan time by acquiring less K-space data. The image is reconstructed from the subsampled K-space data by employing compressed sensing (CS)-based reconstruction techniques. In this article, we propose an alternative approach to CS-based reconstruction. The proposed approach exploits the rank deficiency of the MR images to reconstruct the image. This requires minimizing the rank of the image"

To circumvent this, we developed an autoencoder-based sparse gene expression matrix imputation method. AutoImpute, which learns the inherent distribution of the input scRNA-seq data and imputes"

Therefore, in the formulation of the autoencoder, a supervision penalty is introduced as a jointsparsity promoting l2; 1-norm. The formulation of CSSE is derived for a"

Usually more than 90% of the missing ratings need to be predicted from less than 10% of available ratings. The problem is highly under-determined. In this work, we propose to improve the prediction accuracy by exploiting the user's demographic information. We propose a new formulation to incorporate this information into the matrix completion framework of latent factor based collaborative filtering"

Such outliers are common in biomedical signals eg EEG and ECG. RDDL learns multiple levels of non-linear dictionaries for representing the data. Instead of the standard Euclidean cost function that is usually employed in dictionary learning, we"

In a recent work, it has been shown that it is also possible to reconstruct MR images by exploiting their rank deficiency. In this work, it will be shown that, instead of exploiting the sparsity of the image or rank"

We exploit the spatiospectral correlation present in hyperspectral images to sparsify the datacube. Since impulse noise is sparse, denoising is framed as an \u21131-norm regularized \u21131-norm data fidelity minimization problem. We derive an efficient split Bregman-based algorithm to solve the same. Experiments on real datasets show that our proposed technique, when compared with state-of-the-art denoising algorithms, yields better results."

The proposed blind Kalman filter algorithm proceeds via alternating the estimation of these unknown matrices and the inference of the state, within the framework of expectation-maximization. A mini-batch processing strategy is introduced to allow on-the-fly forecasting. The experimental results show that the proposed method"

Impulse denoising is formulated as minimizing a Lp-regularized Lq-norm data mismatch term. The Lq-norm mismatch arises owing to the fact that the noise is sparse. The Lp-norm exploits the prior information that the image is sparse in a transform domain. The proposed methods have been used to reduce salt and pepper noise as well as random valued impulse noise.

The proposed method exploits the sparsity of feature distribution rather than modeling the data distribution. The proposed sparse filtering based unmixing procedure is essentially parameter-free, and the only parameter is to find the number of endmembers to be extracted. This approach is a blind unmixing approach because it does not require prior knowledge of endmember matrix. Experimental results on two real hyperspectral datasets demonstrate"

In this work we propose to improve the robust dictionary learning approach by imposing low-rank penalty on the learned coefficients. The ensuing formulation is solved using a combination"

However such offline reconstruction precludes application of these techniques where real-time reconstruction is necessary, viz. image guided surgery, catheter tracking etc. To enable such applications, there is an interest in online reconstruction of dynamic MRI. This chapter reviews existing techniques in this area."

Instead of using averaging techniques in conjunction with CS based reconstruction, this work proposes a novel formulation that produces extremely accurate reconstruction results. Our method gives"

In this work we propose a fundamentally new architecture of hierarchical autoencoder. In a normal stacked denoising autoencoder"

The second improvement is in replacing the Euclidean norm for the consistency constraint by a robust l p-norm (0<; p<; 1); this makes the inconsistency robust to changes in magnitude. We compare our proposed modifications with existing work on label consistent KSVD and"

We model T2 maps as a rank-deficient matrix. Since the relationship between T2 values and intensity values/K-space samples is not linear"

Each channel is processed by a separate 1D convolutional transform; the output of all the channels are fused by a fully connected layer of transform learning. The training procedure takes advantage of the proximal interpretation of activation functions. We apply the developed framework to multi-channel financial data for stock forecasting and trading.

Experiments on benchmark datasets shows that our proposed technique significantly outperforms all state-of-the-art collaborative filtering techniques."

This work proposes a transform learning based formulation for the said problem. Till date, it has been used for solving Gaussian denoising problems and MRI reconstruction problems. This is the first work, that proposes solving the impulse denoising problem using"

The corresponding latent representations from all sensors are combined to learn a fusing autoencoder in the second stage. The latent representation of this stage is used to learn a label consistent classifier for multi-class classification. A joint optimization technique is presented for learning the"

This factorization always leaves a residual or approximation error. Very few works in the literature had focused on to leverage the information present in"

The first problem arises when the smart-meter cannot transmit the readings to the server owing to malfunctioning of the WiFi. The second problem arises from transients, surges and other non-linear effects. We modify the dictionary learning based disaggregation framework to address these problems. Results on the REDD dataset shows that results indeed improve when these issues are addressed"

Our simulation results show that our method yields very accurate and robust results from only two partially sampled scans (total scan time being"

When the frames of the dynamic MRI sequences are stacked as columns of a matrix, the resultant matrix is both sparse (in a transform domain) and rank-deficient. The dynamic MRI sequence is reconstructed by solving an optimization problem that minimizes a sum of sparsity and rank-deficiency penalties subject to data constraints (K-space data acquisition model). In this work, we propose a non-convex optimization problem for dynamic MRI"

The second problem arises from transients, surges and other non-linear effects. We modify the dictionary learning based disaggregation framework to address these problems. Results on the REDD dataset shows that results indeed improve when these issues are addressed"

Compressed Sensing (CS) based techniques exploit the sparsity of the CT frames in a transform domain in order to reconstruct them. In a recent paper it was shown that dynamic CT frames when stacked as columns of a Casorati matrix is rank-deficient; the frames are temporally correlated, implying that the columns are not independent from each other. The rank-deficiency of this matrix was exploited to recover the CT frames. In this work"
