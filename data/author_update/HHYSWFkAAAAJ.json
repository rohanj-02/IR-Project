Circular polarization and size reduction are achieved by placing two asymmetric Koch fractal geometries on x-and y-planes of the single-probe feed square radiator. Further, to tune resonant frequency around the 911MHz, four arrow-shaped slots are inserted in diagonal axes of the square radiator. It is perceived that compact size of the antenna can be achieved by increasing the overall size of the arrow"

Since data capture is expensive and time consuming, it is worthwhile to recover missing values instead of re-collecting the data. In this paper, a novel but simple method, namely, DSNN (Doubly Sparse DCT domain with Nuclear Norm minimization) has been proposed for imputing missing values in microarray data. Methods"

Several methods to impute missing values in gene expression data have been developed, but most of these work at high levels of observability. In this paper, we have proposed a nove12-stage method, namely, CT-NNBI of imputing incomplete gene expression matrices using Discrete Cosine Transform Domain"
