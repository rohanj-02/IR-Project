This adaptation was driven by selection-induced gain of H3K27ac marks on bivalently poised resistance"

Instead of regarding noise as the high-frequency part in the data to be removed either by a\" hard\" or\" soft\" threshold, we define it as that part in the data which is harder to compress than the rest with the class of models considered. Here, we model the data by two histograms: one for the denoised signal and the other for the noise, both represented by wavelet coefficients. A code length can be"

The coefficients are distributed to bins in two types of histograms using the principles of Minimum Description Lengthi (MDL). One histogram represents noise"
