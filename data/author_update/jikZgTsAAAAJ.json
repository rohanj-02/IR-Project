In this paper, we address the problem of 2D object reconstruction from arbitrary linear cross sections. This problem has not been much discussed in the literature, but holds great importance since it lifts the requirement of order within the cross sections in a reconstruction problem, consequently making the reconstruction problem harder. Our approach to the reconstruction is via continuous deformations of line intersections in the"

The computation of the medial axis of images is of interest in applications such as mapping, climatology, change detection, medicine, etc. This research work provides a way to automate the computation of"

Our system is capable of directly mapping the colors of a 2D photograph to a 3D MRI volume in real-time, producing a high-fidelity color volume suitable for photo-realistic visualization.

This dual graph captures the fact that two Delaunay triangles share a vertex or an edge. Then, we apply it to the computation of the medial axis of the features selected in an image. The computation of the medial axis of images is of interest in applications such as mapping, climatology, change detection, medicine, etc. This research work provides a way to automate the computation of"
