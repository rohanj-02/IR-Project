However, the capacity of current networks makes packet-level monitoring at such a scale quite challenging. We hypothesize that adversaries could"

We consolidated a list of potentially blocked websites from various public sources to assess censorship mechanisms used by nine major ISPs. To begin with, we demonstrate that existing censorship detection tools like OONI are grossly inaccurate. We thus developed various techniques and heuristics to correctly assess censorship and study the underlying mechanism used by these ISPs. At every step we corroborated our finding manually to test"

It is quite difficult to place DRs so the adversary cannot route around them--for example, we need the cooperation of 850 ASes to contain China alone [1]."

In practice, a well-informed Indian citizen can escape censorship through a judicious choice of service provider.

LinkWidth allows network edge-attached entities to estimate the available bandwidth in an arbitrary Internet link without a cooperating peer host, router, or ISP.

It is possible to induce traffic flow between off-path remote hosts\u2014sending request packets to one host, with a spoofed source IP, will cause the first host to send reply packets to the other. The challenge for MM is to measure the rate at which these packets arrive at the second machine. Our key observation is that if the second machine has a global IP-ID"

Such routers enables their operators to observe contents of network flows (traversing their routers) having specific byte sequences. Tor, a low-latency anonymity network has also been widely used to circumvent censorship and surveillance. However, recent efforts have shown that all"
