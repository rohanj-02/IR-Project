The standard proposes OBSS (Overlapping Basic Service Set) colouring to increase spatial reuse in dense scenarios. We evaluate the"

In this paper, we argue that the blind fallback behavior of QUIC, ie, not distinguishing between failures caused by middleboxes and that caused by network congestion, hugely impacts the performance of QUIC. For this, we focus on YouTube video"
