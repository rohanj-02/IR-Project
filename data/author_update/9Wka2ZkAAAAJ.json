Cyclonic eddy (CE) injected nutrients to photic zone leading to increase in integrated Chl-a to upper 100 m compared to ACE and Transition zone (TZ) region resulting in decrease in DO in the OMZ.

However, navigation in videos is linear as compared to other instructional resources such as textbooks, where a table of topics and a multi-faceted index of different anchor points ie, list of figures, tables aid in efficiently navigating to a desired point of interest. There is a lack of appropriate techniques and interfaces which can support such textbook-style navigation in instructional videos. This paper presents a novel approach to automatically"

Most common way of getting location information is to use specialized hardware like GPS. However, GPS is expensive and is available only on high-end phones restricting its use to a smaller population in developing countries. Further, GPS also consumes a lot of battery power during its operation, thereby making it infeasible to run for longer durations with limited mobile phone battery.

First, its economic incentive model effectively combats free-riding by incentivizing MPs to become brokers and to host replicated data, thereby improving data availability. Second, its"

We evaluated anti-CRP antibodies in Indian SLE patients and their association with anti-dsDNA antibodies and complement levels (C3 and C4). One hundred SLE patients diagnosed according to the American"

We discuss the details of design and implementation of TactBack, and report on a preliminary user study with 15 participants. Our evaluation shows that participants could"

Various modalities of treatment have been proposed ranging from primary closure to the staged closure using prosthetic materials under general anesthesia. One of the modalities is manual ward reduction with primary repair of gastroschisis without anesthesia. We are reporting our 8 years of experience with manual ward reduction of gastroschisis with primary repair without anesthesia. Materials and methods: It is a retrospective analysis of all patients"

Ntr1 interacts with Prp43, a DExD/H box RNA helicase protein, which facilitates the disassembly of spliceosomal intermediates. The interaction between Ntr1 and Prp43 is conserved and crucial for the disassembly process. However, the J-protein"

The FE analysis depicts that the ballistic impact response of plain-woven fabric largely depends on the obliquity of impact due to phenomena like uneven strain distribution in different directions and sliding of the projectile on woven fabric yarns about the point of impact.

We included 47 patients of traumatic thoracolumbar fracture between September 2016 and January 2018"

The main requirement of wireless sensor networks is not only security but energy efficient security due to resource constrained nature of sensor nodes. We have developed an energy and storage efficient key distribution scheme using leveling and sectoring. In this scheme, node communicates with their neighbors to setup pair wise keys without any central authority. Proposed protocol is fully distributed and uses negligible communication for key setups"

The flow pattern within melt pool affects the segregation and melt-pool shape and size. The flow pattern and therefore the melt pool shape vary with the\u2202 \u03b3/\u2202 T, which is dependent on temperature and surface active elements concentration in the molten metal"
