In contrast to previous joint frameworks that use bounding box proposals to attack the problem, we propose to leverage co-saliency activated tracklets to address the challenge. To identify the common visual object, we first explore inter-video commonness, intra-video commonness, and motion"

In this paper, we propose a simple cosaliency estimation method where we fuse saliency maps of different images using the dense correspondence"

Some of the abnormalities involve the circumduction of legs, forward-bending, involuntary movements, etc. To detect such abnormalities in gait, we develop gait features from the key-points of the human pose"

Although previous works did utilize images/videos to detect this disorder, none have explicitly focused on the eyes. Most of them require the entire face. One obvious advantage of having an eye-focused detection system is that subjects' anonymity is"

Although weak supervision is beneficial, it is not entirely reliable, for the results are quite sensitive to the neighboring images considered. In this paper, we combine it with a self-awareness phenomenon to mitigate this issue. By self-awareness here, we refer to the"
