The collection of knowledge and interpretation in publications needs to be distilled into evidence by leveraging natural language in ways beyond standard meta-analysis. Several studies have focused on mining evidence from text using natural language processing, and have focused on a handful of diseases. Here we show that new knowledge can be captured, tracked and predicted using the evolution of unsupervised"

In this paper we developed a suite of models to guide development of policies under different scenarios when the lockdown opens. These had been deployed to create an"
