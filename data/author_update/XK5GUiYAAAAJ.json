IL-13 induces the pathogenesis of many allergic diseases, such as airway hyperresponsiveness, glycoprotein hypersecretion, and goblet cell hyperplasia. In addition, IL-13 inhibits tumor immunosurveillance, leading to carcinogenesis. Since elevated IL-13 serum levels are severe in COVID-19 patients, predicting IL-13 inducing peptides or regions in a protein is vital to designing safe protein therapeutics"

We analyzed 77 biologically active peptides with length varying from 9 to 20 residues. Out of 77 peptides, 58 peptides were found to contain at least one \u03b2-turn. Further, at the residue level, 34.9% of total peptide residues were found to be in \u03b2-turns, higher than the number of helical (32.3%) and \u03b2-sheet residues (6.9%). So, we utilized the predicted \u03b2-turns information to develop an improved method for predicting the three-dimensional (3D)"

Understanding their origin and evolution is of fundamental importance for genome studies. The identification of repeats and their units helps in deducing the intra-genomic dynamics as an important feature of comparative genomics. A major difficulty in identification of repeats arises from the fact that the repeat units can be either exact or imperfect, in tandem or dispersed, and of unspecified length"

The resulting models accurately predicted odor intensity and pleasantness and also successfully predicted 8 among 19 rated semantic descriptors"

However, the major limitation of Betatpred2 is that it predicts only \u03b2-turn and non-\u03b2-turn residues and does not provide any information of different \u03b2-turn types.

High throughput techniques like next generation sequencing have resulted in the generation of vast amounts of sequence data. It is therefore desirable, not only to discriminate coding and non-coding transcripts, but also to assign the noncoding RNA (ncRNA) transcripts into respective classes (families). Although there are several algorithms available for this task, their classification performance remains"

The production of anti-hapten antibodies of desired specificity largely depends on the hapten design (preserving greatly the chemical structure and spatial conformation of target compound), selection of the appropriate carrier protein and the conjugation method.

One of the major limitations of RNA-based therapeutics is immunotoxicity of RNA molecules as it may induce the innate immune system. In contrast, RNA molecules that are potent immunostimulators are strong candidates"

Firstly, a similarity-based approach using BLAST was used to predict PRRs and got limited success due to a large number of no-hits. Secondly, machine learning-based models were"

Further, there is no online tool available which can help the plant researchers or farmers in timely application of control measures. This paper introduces a new prediction"

Users can evaluate their method on any subset or a complete set of data. The method is assessed at amino acid level and performance is evaluated in terms"

In order to calculate the endpoint titer, we first fit the OD versus concentration of control data using a least-squares curve-fitting method.

The structural and sequence features on pre-miRNA which can facilitate position and efficiency of cleavage are not well known. A precise cleavage by Dicer is crucial because an inaccurate processing can produce miRNA with different seed regions which can alter the repertoire of target genes. In this study, a novel method has been developed to predict Dicer cleavage sites on pre-miRNAs using Support Vector Machine"

Unfortunately tertiary structures of limited proteins are available. Therefore, it is important to develop in-silico models for predicting vitamin interacting residues in protein from its primary"

The capability to recognize the cancer-associated mutations by the immune system depends on the presence of a particular set of alleles, that elicit an immune response to fight against cancer. Therefore, the occurrence of specific HLA"
