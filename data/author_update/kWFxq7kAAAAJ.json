The prototype, developed on RO4350B op-erates at 0.4 GHz and occupies a board area of 30\u00d7 30 mm 2. The proposed WPT system advances the existing state-of-the-art by exhibiting significantly superior figures of merit (FoM). In particular, it possesses a constant efficiency of 86% between 20 mm and 35 mm around the industrial"

To verify the given design procedure, a 90\u00b0 phase shifter, working at 1.8 GHz, is prototyped on Rogers5880 with substrate thickness of 1.575 mm and dielectric constant of 2.2.

To illustrate the proposed idea, design parameters for differential phases of 45, 60, 75, 90, 105 and 120 are evaluated and tabulated considering a"

Seagrass provide habitats for fish and invertebrates, provides food, purifies water, stabilize sediment so its sustainability needs to be maintained. Due to human activities like sewage input, dumping of solid waste on the shoreline and anchoring of boats, the population of seagrass has been decreasing continuously which has led to instability in the marine ecosystem. Maping and classifying the seagrass from the remote place and from satellite image is very complex task"
