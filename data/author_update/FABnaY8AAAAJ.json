In those cases, static output feedback (SOF) controller can be used as an alternative framework for feedback control. Structured SOF (SSOF) is a class of SOF for which the controller gain structure is predefined. In this work, a new output feedback gain design procedure is proposed for a class of linear time invariant systems"

We consider Gramian-based performance metrics and propose a novel notion of edge centrality that encodes the first-order variation in the metric with respect to the modification of the corresponding edge weight, including for those edges not present in the network. The proposed edge centrality matrix (ECM) is additive over the set of inputs, ie, it captures the"
