Existing techniques for disaggregation rely on energy metering at a resolution of 1 minute or higher, but most power meters today only provide a reading once per month, and at most once every 15 minutes. In this paper, we propose a new technique called Neighbourhood NILM that leverages data from'neighbouring'homes to disaggregate"

However, existing approaches to produce an energy breakdown require hardware to be installed in each home and are thus prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we propose a novel application of feature-based matrix factorisation that does not require any additional hard-ware installation. The basic premise"

In developing nations, IVR systems are mostly touch-tone (key-press) because of under-supported speech technologies for non-English native languages and accents. Optimizing such IVR systems is crucial as they are often considered as time consuming and frustrating and further becomes more challenging"

Most common way of getting location information is to use specialized hardware like GPS. However, GPS is expensive and is available only on high-end phones restricting its use to a smaller population in developing countries. Further, GPS also consumes a lot of battery power during its operation, thereby making it infeasible to run for longer durations with limited mobile phone battery.

Adaptive interfaces play significant role when optimality varies with time. However, the negative impacts of adaptive interfaces on the users familiar with the"

Although RDF/XML has been widely recognized as the standard vehicle for describing metadata, an enormous amount of semantic data is still being encoded in HTML documents that are designed primarily for human consumption. Tools such as those pioneered by SHOE [Heflin et al., 2003] and Ontobroker [Fensel et al., 1998] facilitate manual annotation of HTML documents with semantic markups."
