Ultra-low energy consumption in high-speed logic devices can be envisioned by inducing ferromagnetic behavior into room temperature multiferroic materials. However, there is a scarcity of room temperature multiferroic materials which have a definite spin degree of freedom. To fully exploit these technological challenges, we introduce the induced"

We first study the imaginary band structure of hexagonal and Bernal-stacked heterobilayers by density functional theory, which is then used to evaluate the gate-controlled current under the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation. It is shown that the direct BTBT is probable for a certain interlayer spacing of the G-BN which depends on the stacking orders."
