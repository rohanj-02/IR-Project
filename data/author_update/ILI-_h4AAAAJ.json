The temporal nature of the data inserted by the Hyperledger Fabric transactions can be leveraged to support various use-cases. This requires that the temporal queries be processed efficiently on this data. Currently this presents significant challenges as this data is organized on file-system, is exposed to users via a limited API and does not support any temporal indexes"

In a concurrent setting, where dynamic modifications are allowed, a linearizable implementation of the NNS is highly desirable. This paper introduces the LockFree-kD-tree (LFkD-tree): a lock-free concurrent kD-tree, which implements an abstract data type (ADT) that provides the operations Add, Remove, Contains, and NNS. Our implementation is linearizable. The operations in the LFkD-tree use"

This is all the more surprising since these objectives are the ones appearing in the training of deep neural networks. In this paper, we introduce the first convergence"

To describe the concept, we revisit the designs of a lock-free linked-list and a lock-free binary search tree and present improved algorithms. Our algorithms"

To our knowledge, there is no convergence theory of such methods, nor systematic numerical comparisons evaluating speed-up. In this paper, we propose an"
