Our method defines a published view V to preserve the privacy of a secret query Q if V and Q return no tuples in common, over all possible database instances. We then establish necessary and sufficient conditions that characterize when V preserves the privacy of Q in terms of the projected inequalities in the queries, both for conjunctive queries and queries with negation. We also show that integrity constraints have an effect on privacy, and"

The overall revenue realized by the auctioneer in such an auction is given by R= Q\u00d7 pw where, Q is the number of units of the item being auctioned, and pw is the lowest winning bid price at the end of the auction. R is only dependent on pw (Q being fixed) and an interesting question is whether it is possible to increase R. Proposed in this paper is a method for increasing pw (and consequently R)"

The hierarchical model consists of physical pages, logical pages and topics, corresponding to different abstraction level. Based on this model, we then develop searching and topic navigation facilities for easily finding relevant contents in cache. By defining priorities on each abstraction level, the"

In this demo, we showcase how predictive algorithms leveraging the state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning techniques can be used to improve understanding of patents for inventors, patent evaluators, and business analysts alike.

Subsequence search is equivalent to searching for regular expressions of the type.* q 1.* q 2.*.* ql.*, where the subsequence is q 1 q 2 ql. For efficient execution of these queries, there is a need for appropriate index structures that are both efficient and can scale to large problem sizes. This paper presents two index structures for such queries based on trie and bitmap. These indices are disk-resident, hence"

Poor quality data can lead to incorrect reporting and wrong conclusions being drawn. Data cleansing involves standardizing such data to improve its quality. Often data cleansing tasks involve writing rules manually. The step involves understanding the data quality issues and then writing data transformation rules to correct these issues. This is a human intensive task. In this study we propose a method to identify noisy subsets of huge"

Materialised views are important in data warehousing where they are used to speed up query processing on large amounts of data. User requirements change over time, which may change the definitions of views dynamically. For such situations, the question arises whether the materialised views should be recomputed from scratch for every change in the definition or they should be obtained by adapting old materialised views.

We address these two classes of join queries, discuss the challenges and outline novel approaches for executing these queries on a map-reduce framework. We then discuss how we can process join queries involving both overlap and range predicates. Specifically we present a Controlled-Replicate framework using which we design the approaches presented in this"

One of the key challenges from database perspective is how to ensure all the data pertaining to the actual trip and premium payment made by the users are transparently recorded so that every party in the insurance contract including the driver, the insurance"

We show that a materialized view can be maintained without accessing the view itself by materializing additional relations. We firstly give an algorithm for determining what"

In this paper, we develop a framework for applying the partitioning technique on DW schema (star schema) to reduce the total query"

The operators that realise these methods are composed from the basic set given in the data model, and the strategies are shown to satisfy the fragmentation correctness rules."

One of these models is the nested relational model that is used in the modelling of complex objects in databases. In this paper, we derive a group of expressions for incrementally evaluating query expressions in the nested relational model. We also present an algorithm to propagate base relation updates to a materialized view when the view is defined as a complex query."

A fundamental problem in clickstream analysis is the computation of the distance (or the similarity) between two clickstreams. While, there exists a considerable amount of literature which propose methods of computing path similarities, they rely on the edit distance or the related longest common subsequence to align the two clickstreams. The edit distance provides a least cost"

On the other hand, data partitioning can also greatly increase the performance of queries. Data partitioning has advantage over data selection and indexing since the former one does not require additional storage requirement. In this paper, we show that it is beneficial to integrate"

In this paper we consider the problem of checking the satisfaction of a set of XMVDs in an XML document. We present an algorithm using extensible hashing to check whether an XML document satisfies a given set of XMVDs. The performance of the algorithm is shown to be linear in relation to the number of tuples of the XML document, a measure which is related to, but not the same as, the size"

In particular, their role is crucial to the success of data warehouses where they are used to speed up query processing on large amounts of data. The definition of a view can change over time since it is dependent on users requirements and they themselves change over time. For such situations, the question arises whether the materialised view should be recomputed from scratch for every change in the definition or whether it should be obtained"
