Prior work has demonstrated that work-stealing is very effective in practice. However, work-stealing comes with a substantial overhead: as much as 2x to 12x slowdown over orthodox sequential code.

A popular approach for exploiting software parallelism on parallel hardware is task parallelism, where the programmer explicitly identifies potential parallelism and the runtime then schedules the work. Work-stealing is a promising scheduling strategy that a runtime may use to keep otherwise idle hardware busy while relieving overloaded hardware of its burden. However, work-stealing comes with substantial overheads. Recent work identified"
