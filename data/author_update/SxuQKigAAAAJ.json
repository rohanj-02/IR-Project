The design is modular owing to lifting framework wherein both predict and update stage polynomials are obtained from the given signal. Successive predict stages are designed using the least squares criterion, while the update stages are designed with total variation minimization on the wavelet approximation coefficients. Different design strategies for compression and denoising are presented. The efficacy of matched-wavelets is illustrated on transform coding"

Shallow water acoustic channel is generally challenging to track under moderate to rough sea conditions. This is primarily due to non-stationary highly transient elements within the channel delay spread resulting from rapidly fluctuating multipath arrivals"

Impulse noise is sparse; removing impulse noise requires minimizing an l 1-norm data fidelity term. Prior studies have exploited the intra-band spatial correlation (leading to sparsity in transform domain) and inter-band spectral-correlation (joint-sparsity) of hyper-spectral images for Gaussian denoising. In this work, we propose to learn the joint-sparsity promoting dictionary adaptively from the data for impulse denoising problems. Unlike"
