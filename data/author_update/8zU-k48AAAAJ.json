Based on empirical tests on the tag, we estimate the radar probability of detection and probability of false alarms as 88% and 0.3% respectively.

We investigated the role of a gustatory cue, aphid honeydew (excretion of feeding aphids), in foraging behavior of convergent ladybird beetle (Hippodamia convergens) larvae. We conducted laboratory experiments to examine if the presence, type, and amount of honeydew influences the patch residence time of the"
