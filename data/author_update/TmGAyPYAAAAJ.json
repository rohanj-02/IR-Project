Currently, most personal smart devices employ one of the one-time user authentication schemes, such as four-to-six digits, fingerprint or pattern-based schemes. These authentication schemes are often not good enough for securing personal smart devices"

Future projection can be used to anticipate an unseen environment for autonomous driving. Road environment is highly dynamic and complex due to the interaction among traffic participants such as vehicles and pedestrians. Even in such a complex environment, a human driver can easily anticipate the environment and is efficacious to drive safely on the chaotic roads"
