These systems generally use proprietary acquisition platforms that are incompatible with each other which makes this even more challenging. This study presents a compressive sensing-based biopotential acquisition unit to reduce the overheads of wirelessly transmitting and storing the data. The instrumentation amplifier (INA) in the system defines the quality of the acquired biopotential signals. At the heart of the system is an"
