Therefore, non-charge based memory technologies such as Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM) become promising for future applications. RRAM is not only more scalable, but is typically faster and consumes less power than the existing memory technologies. However, RRAM suffers from higher impact of variations and reliability issues. In this review paper, we explain the basic aspects of"
