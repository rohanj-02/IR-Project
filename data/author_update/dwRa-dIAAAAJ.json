These radars usually operate in the unlicensed 2.4 GHz ISM band and are therefore susceptible to interference from WiFi networks operating with the IEEE 802.11 g protocol. In this work, we show, through experiments, how the radar degrades the WiFi throughput by lowering the signal to noise and interference ratio at the WiFi receiver. Similarly, WiFi interference causes deterioration"

This work presents the development of a working prototype of a narrow-band harmonic radar system, at 2.5/5GHz, using off-the-shelf components to detect the presence of Indian honey bees. Based on empirical tests on the tag, we estimate the radar probability of detection and probability of false alarms as 88% and 0.3% respectively. The maximum detectable range for a monostatic configuration of the radar is 3.84 m."

The traditional radar fails to detect the bees due to their very low radar cross-section caused by their small sizes. The harmonic radar overcomes this limitation by tagging the insects with a harmonic tag consisting of a dipole and a diode. The tag utilizes the nonlinearity property of the diode to convert the carrier frequency of the transmitted signal received by the dipole"

Despite this, these signals are fairly ubiquitous. Hence, we explore the possibility of leveraging the weak EMI signals for two applications-appliance detection and energy"
