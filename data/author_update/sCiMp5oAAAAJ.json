Different implementation choices can result in code snippets that are similar, and have been defined in multiple ways: code clones, examples, simions and variants. Currently, there is a lack of a consistent and unambiguous definition of such types of code snippets. Here we present a characterization study of code variants-a specific type of code snippets that differ from each other by at least one desired property, within a given code context. We distinguish code"

However, searching for such code variants over the web has several challenges. In this dissertation, we address this problem. This dissertation"
