As a result, the detection of median filtering has become of great significance for forensic analysis. To this end, several median filtering detectors have been proposed. In order to counter this, various anti-forensic techniques have also been suggested. In this paper we propose an effective anti-forensic"

Most of them use hierarchical features learned from multiple layers of a deep network. However, issues related to deterministic aggregation of these features from various layers, difficulties in estimating variations in scale or rotation of the object being tracked, as well as challenges in effectively modeling the object's appearance over long time periods leaves substantial scope to improve performance. In this paper, we propose a tracker that"

By imposing a sparsity penalty on these variations, the formulation ensures that only relevant changes are incorporated during updates. This results in more robust filter coefficients that minimize the tracking drift. The IGSSTRCF also includes an adaptive channel importance estimation"
