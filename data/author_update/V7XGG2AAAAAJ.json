We demonstrate the superiority of the DP technique over the existing techniques in controlling the ambipolar current.

The control gate provides the necessary holes that suppress the diffusion current in the \u201c0\u201d state. As a result, 1/0 read current ratio also increases by 3 orders of magnitude.

The design will be fabricated on a Rogers RT 5880 board with a dielectric constant of 2.2 and a loss tangent of 0.0009. The tag is based on the concept of re-transmission and therefore require an external set of monopole patch antennas as part of the system. The design employ the use of L resonators with various, de ned lengths which in turn resonate at di erent frequencies. The presence or absence of a resonator at a particular frequency is encoded as a 1 or 0. These tags are"
