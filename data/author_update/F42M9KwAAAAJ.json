Translating the natural language requirements to a more formal specification is a challenging task. One possible approach to handle complex natural language requirements is to convert them to an intermediary formal representation. This intermediate representation is further converted into a more formal representation such as EDT (Expressive Decision Tables). In this paper, we use Petri nets in combination with domain based context"

Natural language based user-interface to business applications is one alternative.

For explaining the decisions arrived by Black box deep learning models, we argue that it is essential to reproduce that model's view of the training data faithfully. This faithful reproduction can then be used for explanation generation. We investigate two methods for"
