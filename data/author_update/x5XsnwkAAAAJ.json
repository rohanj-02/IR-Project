Algorithms that rely on distance metrics are computationally efficient and can handle large datasets, however, default distances in the embedded space often yield inadequate accuracy.

Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) has led to more effective models for ETA estimation that rely heavily on a large GPS datasets. More importantly, these are mainly cabs based datasets which may not be fit for bus based public transport. Consequently, the latest methods may not be applicable for ETA estimation in cities with the absence of large training data set. On the other hand, the ETA estimation"

G. fast standards define Discontinuous Operation modes that provide avenues for power reduction by allowing intermittent transmission of users a long time slots. We formulate power efficiency problem as a user-slot assignment problem, where we schedule users to time slots during discontinuous operation such that the total power consumption is"

Traditionally researchers have dealt with the problem of classification and pairing separately. In our work, we propose to jointly optimize the solutions of these two very closely related problems. The combined problem is formulated into one of optimal three-dimensional assignment with an objective function of maximum likelihood. This formulation poses two technical challenges: 1. estimation of the posterior probability that two"
