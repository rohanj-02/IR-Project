Although such a large single-cell cohort may favor the discovery of cellular heterogeneity, it also brings new challenges in the prediction of minority cell types. Identification of any minority cell type holds a special significance in knowledge discovery. In the analysis of single-cell expression data, the use of principal component analysis (PCA) is surprisingly frequent for dimension reduction. The"

However, the cases of early relapse (within 36 months) after the stem cell rescue remains a significant challenge. For a lot of practical purposes, it is crucial to identify whether a patient undergoing ASCT falls into the high-risk group (likely to relapse within 36 months) or a low risk one. Our analysis showed that existing MM staging systems (International Staging System or ISS and Durie"

In this paper we use quasi clique based partitioning to study social cohesion. We propose a greedy algorithm based on the notion of strong Nash stability to determine the cohesive subgroups in a network. Through experimental results we show that the proposed algorithm yields promising results by identifying meaningful, compact and dense clusters in many real life social network data sets."

Results on 115 benchmark datasets show that GRAF yields comparable or better results on a majority of datasets. We"
