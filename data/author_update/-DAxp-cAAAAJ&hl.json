Further, images captured in visible spectrum are more susceptible to noise than if captured in near infrared spectrum. This research proposes periocular biometrics as an alternative to iris recognition if the iris images are captured at a distance. We propose a novel algorithm to recognize periocular images in visible spectrum and study the effect of capture distance on the performance of periocular biometrics. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated on"

The proposed algorithm is robust to geometric and frequency attacks and protects the integrity of both the face template and the fingerprint image. Experimental results performed on a database of 750 face and 750 fingerprint images show that the algorithm has the advantages of both the existing DWT and LSB based algorithms. A multimodal biometric algorithm is used as a metric to evaluate the"

We propose a framework, termed as Aravrta 1, which classifies the local facial regions of both visible and thermal face images into biometric (regions without"

At feature level fusion, the amplitude and phase features are extracted from the fused image using 2D log polar Gabor wavelet. An adaptive SVM learning algorithm intelligently selects either the amplitude or phase features to generate a fused feature set for"

The presence of contact lens, particularly color cosmetic lens, may also pose a challenge to iris biometrics as it obfuscates the iris patterns and changes the inter and intra-class distributions.

It is very unique and one of the most accurate biometric modalities. However, spoofing techniques can be used to obfuscate or impersonate identities and increase the risk of false acceptance or false rejection. This paper revisits iris recognition with spoofing attacks and analyzes their effect on the recognition performance. Specifically, print attack with contact lens variations is used as the spoofing mechanism. It is observed"

The proposed algorithm registers the gallery and probe face images in polar coordinate domain and minimizes the variations in facial features caused due to aging. The efficacy of the proposed age transformation algorithm is validated using 2D log polar Gabor based face recognition algorithm on a face database that comprises of face images with large age progression. Experimental results show that the proposed"

In this paper, we propose a regularizer-based approach to learn weight invariant facial representations using two different deep learning architectures, namely, sparse-stacked denoising autoencoders and deep Boltzmann machines. We incorporate a body-weight aware regularization parameter in the"

At the first level of granularity, both pre and post-surgery face images are processed by Gaussian and Laplacian operators to obtain face granules at"

This research proposes a two fold contribution for advancing the state-of-art in recognizing face images with variations caused due to substance abuse: firstly, scattering transform (ScatNet) based face recognition algorithm is proposed. The algorithm yields good results however, it is very expensive in terms of the computational time and space. Therefore, as the next contribution, an"

In this paper, we propose the semi-supervised class sparsity signature based RBM formulation by combining unsupervised generative training of the RBM with a supervised sparsity"

In this paper, a novel framework is proposed which transfers fundamental visual features learnt from a generic image dataset to supplement a supervised face recognition model. The proposed algorithm combines off-the-shelf supervised classifier and a generic, task independent network which encodes information"

However, obtaining skin color consistency across illumination, different camera settings, and diverse ethnicity is a challenging task. Static skin color models that rely on image preprocessing are able to bring only limited consistency. Their performance in terms of accuracy and computation time degrades severely in real"

Due to their convenience, these mobile devices are also utilized in unconstrained outdoor scenarios. This has necessitated the development of reliable iris recognition algorithms for such uncontrolled environment. At the same time, iris presentation attacks pose a major challenge to current iris recognition systems. It has been shown that print attacks and textured contact lens may significantly degrade the iris recognition performance. Motivated"

Experimental results on a high resolution fingerprint database show that the proposed algorithm improves the identification performance by at least 10% compared to existing fingerprint identification"

However, there are a lot of small sample size or S 3 problems for which it is not feasible to collect large training databases. It has been observed that deep learning models do not generalize well on S 3 problems and specialized solutions are required. In"

In most of the applications, camera vision techniques using stereo-vision and laser scanners have been used.

Optical flow based models using monocular vision have shown promise in biomimetic systems to estimate depth information from a scene. In this paper, we propose an obstacle avoidance algorithm that learns optical flow patterns through an SVM"

This paper formally introduces the concept of online learning in biometrics. We demonstrate its application in classifier update algorithms to re-train classifier decision boundaries. Specifically, the algorithm employs online learning technique"

While the performance of automated algorithms is close to perfect in constrained environments with controlled illumination, pose, and expression variations, recognition in unconstrained environments is still difficult. To mitigate the effect of some of these challenges, researchers have proposed to utilize 3D images which can encode much more information about the face than 2D images. However"

By utilizing this gradient information, a simple gradient sign method based attack is developed to fool the deep learning models. However, the primary concern with this attack is the perceptibility of noise for large degradation in"

Using these features and random decision forest, fusion and classification is performed and verification results are reported. On CASIA V4-at-a-distance and FOCS databases, the proposed algorithm yields state-of-the-art results;"

Since surveillance cameras typically acquire images at a large standoff distance, the effective resolution of the face is not large enough to identify the individuals. Moreover for a 24-hour surveillance footage, images in low light and at nighttime are acquired in NIR mode which makes the identification problem even more challenging. We propose an effective method using both hand-crafted and learned features for face"

Further, quality of the extracted iris image is improved using SVM based enhancement algorithm. In this algorithm, selected enhancement algorithms globally"

In this research, we aim to design a defense model that is robust within a certain bound against both seen and unseen adversarial"

Due to its impact on society, it has become imperative to ensure that these systems do not discriminate based on gender, identity, or skin tone of individuals. This has led to research in the identification and mitigation of bias in AI systems. In this paper, we encapsulate bias detection/estimation and mitigation algorithms for facial analysis. Our main contributions include a systematic review of algorithms proposed for"

Maintaining an optimal inter-class separation among the classes without affecting the intra-class distance of the data distribution is a challenging task.

Active learning techniques helps in utilizing unlabelled data which may result in an improved classification model. In this research, we present an active learning algorithm which can help in increasing performance of deep learning models by using large amount of"
