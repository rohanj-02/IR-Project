Primary purpose of the LNA is to amplify the received signal while at the same time adding as little additional noise as possible. Its performance greatly affects the overall receiver performance. This thesis discusses design of narrow band low noise amplifiers for Ku band applications. The target of this thesis is to design a LNA at 17 GHz for Ku Band. It also addresses some of the main aspects of microwave LNA design for use in"

The proposed design, intended for high\u2010frequency applications, uses Half\u2010Mode Substrate Integrated Waveguide structure to realise the forward coupler. It thus achieves compactness, requiring approximately half the area compared to Substrate Integrated Waveguide structures, and supports non Transverse Electromagnetic (TEM) functionality. The non\u2010TEM environment provides the flexibility to use the frequency generator for chipless Radio Frequency"
