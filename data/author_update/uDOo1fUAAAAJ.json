Using Fully Depleted Silicon-On-Insulator (FDSOI) devices significantly improves the trade-off between leakage, variability and speed even at low-voltage.

The memory elements hold high density latches to store data and these latches are susceptible to disturbs due to particle strikes. The alpha particles, neutrons from cosmic rays may cause Single Event Upset (SEU) in memory cells. In this paper, we propose a method to estimate and compare SER robustness of different layout topologies of SRAM cell. We demonstrate that the radiation hardened layout topologies offer much better"

Cell stability defined by the Static Noise Margin (SNM) of the SRAM cell among other figure of merits (FOMs) governs the yield in SRAMs. Variations in the scaled SRAMs increase the probability of cells becoming weak. To ensure reliability of SRAMs it is important to identify such cells post fabrication. In this work, we propose a correlation based test methodology to detect the weak bits in SRAMs with respect to SNM. The proposed"

This paper presents the design of a high-density SRAM memory cell suite comprising of different configurations of IRIW 8T cell and a conventional 6T cell in 65nm low standby power (LSTP) technology node. The effect of using assist schemes to lower minimum operational voltage ($ V_ {\\min} $) of the SRAM cell is evaluated. We show that"

It ensures the safe operating area limit of thin gate devices in STMicroelectronics 65nm Low Standby Power (LSTP) triple well technology. The proposed design operates at 800MHz and has a low static power consumption of 112.91 nW at 1.2 V input. The proposed level shifter is variation tolerant and also works at input signals down to"
