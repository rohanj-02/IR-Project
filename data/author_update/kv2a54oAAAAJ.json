A significant bottleneck in Apriori is the number of I/O operation involved, and the number of candidates it generates. We investigate the role of LSH techniques to overcome these problems, without adding much computational overhead. We propose randomized variations of Apriori that are based on asymmetric LSH defined over Hamming distance and Jaccard similarity."

The derivative of a Boolean function is an extension of autocorrelation to correlation among multiple values of f (). The Walsh spectrum is well-studied primarily due to"

In particular, we study generalized utility functions that are subadditive and monotone (SM). We also describe a novel function that allows us to include external information in the form of a relationship graph for computing utility. Next, we"

Therefore, it is crucial to detect citation anomalies for further identifying manipulation and inflation of impact factor. Citation network models the citation relationship between journals in terms of a directed graph. Detecting anomalies in the citation network is a challenging task which has several"

This allows us to efficiently determine test input states as well as measurement strategy that can be used to detect every single-gate fault using very few test cases and with minimal probability of error; in fact we demonstrate that most commonly"

We consider the problem of detecting such faults; the detection algorithm can query the faulty gate and its complexity is the number of such queries. This problem is related to determining the sensitivity of Boolean functions. We show how quantum parallelism can be used to detect"

In this work we show how to use these structures to identify structural-functional communities in networks. We also designed a few metrics to analyse those"
