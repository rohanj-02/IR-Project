In this paper we have developed a basic cloud based architecture for knowing the localization information of a robot in a dynamic environment. Subsequently, this information could be useful to guide the robot in the desired path as trained by the central cloud. In this paper, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is used for the training of locations with Radial Basis Function (RBF). The idea is to establish the communication between the cloud"

According to the earlier studies, a small feature set is used for the extraction of facial features for FER system. To date, a systematic comparison of the facial features does not exist. Therefore, in the current research, we identified 18 different"
