However, the complexity of the natural language constructs makes this task very challenging. Deep Learning architectures such as LSTMs, CNNs, and RNNs show promise in sentence level classification problems. This work investigates the ability of deep learning architectures to build an accurate and"

Religious Hate Speech, in particular, often leads to unrest and sometimes aggravates to violence against people on the basis of their religious affiliations. The richness of the Arabic morphology and the limited available resources makes this task especially challenging. The current state-of-the-art approaches to detect hate speech in Arabic rely entirely on textual (lexical and semantic)"

Contextualizing the build-up of such ideation is critical for the identification of users at risk. In this work, we focus on identifying suicidal intent in tweets by augmenting linguistic models with emotional phases modeled from users' historical context. We propose PHASE, a time-and phase-aware framework that adaptively learns features from a user's historical emotional spectrum"

To this end, we reformulate suicide risk assessment as an Ordinal Regression problem, over the Columbia-Suicide Severity Scale. We propose SISMO, a hierarchical attention model"

Our strategy is to create virtual training samples by interpolating speech samples in hidden space. SpeechMix has the potential to generate an infinite number of new augmented speech samples since the combination of speech samples is continuous. Thus, it allows downstream models to avoid overfitting drastically. Unlike other mixing strategies that only work on the input space, we apply our method on the intermediate layers"
